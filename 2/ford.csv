Ford,Nice parking a-hole,1
Ford,"Your VIN has encoded in it apart from other things the factory of production as well as the date.  Sometimes they encode them as a hex value as to save space and use other parts of the VIN to denote other info (paint color etc.) it all depends on the manufacturer really.


But what they do is search a database of owners to vins (maintained from state vehicle registration), and send letters out to the people owning cars with VIN numbers that are affected.


The reason the dealership told you that you are good to go is that they simply searched ford's database of affected vehicles and your VIN # didn't come up meaning that your car was likely built after the problem was fixed in manufacturing.  Or all those fuel pumps came from a bad batch and they know which cars that batch ended up in because they keep track of all that data when they build your car.


edit: an example is that I had BMW run my vin for me and then print out a list of part names and numbers.  All of them for every part of my car.  My car was built at an odd time between model years (it was a special order the PO did) and has a bunch of weird parts combinations in it (I got the hydraulic belt tensioners but retained the older higher boost luk LF-30 power steering pump.  The cars built my model year saw the hydraulic tensionsers and the LF-20, the year before it the LF-30 and mechanical tensioners).  It makes it a pain to work on because some of these parts require additional hardware to mount etc.  So i got them to run my VIN and get a list of every single part number on my car.",3
Ford,"Yeah here in GA if you're a new car dealer then you get a white plate that says it and if you sell used cars you get a red plate that says used car dealer.

Not that I can really talk, my bronco gets 12mpg on a good day. Expect maintenence on the drivetrain to be similar to a normal F150. Obviously the suspension is much more expensive than a normal F150 but I would be surprised if you had any problems with it in the first 5-10 years. Just remember that it has a midtravel suspension setup, not a longtravel. It can handle a lot but don't expect it to do trophy truck type stuff. Other than that, it's pretty much just a beefed up F150.",2
Ford,Good reply from a wonderful username. Yeah my 2007.5 silverado gets like 13 haha so gas mileage isnt a concern to me ,3
Ford,Damn nice!!! ,1
Ford,"Also, there are some threads over in /r/FordRaptor that could help.",2
Ford,"Hah, thanks. Glad you're converting to the blue oval haha. You're never going to get great gas milage in a fullsize truck. The best gas milage in a half ton right now is the Dodge Ram EcoDiesel at 23 city, 28 highway, which is phenomenal. As for gas engines.... you're gonna average around 12-15 in the city, 17-20 on the highway. The raptor is worse though because of the tires. They're actually 315/70R17, which is close to a 35x12.5. They are rated at 11 city, 16 highway with the 6.2. Aerodynamics of a brick haha. That's honestly not that bad. It's about what I get in my 351w bronco. I'm sure you can help that with a tune, exhaust, and intake but it won't be much. Also the stock tires run about $250 a tire but those tires wear like steel so they'll last 50,000+ miles. I'm sure that a 35x12.5R17 would be a cheaper tire because it is just so much more common.

Edit: I stand corrected, 35x12.5 tires are actually more expensive.  ",1
Ford,Agreed. I love my ST.,5
Ford,Most Raptor buyers aren't too concerned with gas mileage.,2
Ford,Please take it off road every once in a while ,5
Ford,"Most fullsize truck buyers aren't concerned with gas milage. Sure, it would be great to get 40mpg in the city but that's not gonna happen. If you're getting a fullsize (or even a midsize), you should understand that you're gonna be paying a lot for gas. It just comes with the territory. If you want to spend less on gas you should get a smaller car. Though with Dodge putting out the EcoDiesel, Ford shaving 700lbs off their trucks and offering a new 2.7L ecoboost, and Chevy putting a diesel into the Colorado/Canyon, I think that we're gonna see some much more fuel efficient trucks in the next few years. I'd like to see Ford put out a mini powerstroke but they seem to be pushing the ecoboost instead. ",1

Ford,"Yeah they were ~$275 on tire rack. They're actually 315/70R17 which is about 34.5x12.4. The 315/70R17 is actually cheaper than the 35x12.5R17, which surprised me. I would imagine that all-terrains aren't super popular in 35"". ",1
Ford,"Ohh I thought mine were 35"" but maybe they just round up?",1
Ford,We use a trailer or our f150 for that,2
Ford,And chicks will probably dig the Fiesta ST in Green Envy more than a Mustang.,3
Ford,I guess. Tire rack said that the stock tire is 315/70R17. It's close enough to a 35 so they must just call them 35s. Also they could've changed from a true 35 to 315/70R17 at some point. ,1

Ford,What year bronco do you have? I actually just got mine yesterday. '94 with a 351 ,1
Ford,"It's a '95 eddie bauer with the 351W. Congrats on joining the bronco family! I absolutely love mine and at 185,000 miles we still haven't had any major problems. ",1
Ford,"My dad owned a 87 Eddie Bauer. Mine is an Eddie Bauer also. Granted I got mine with 248k miles with some minor rust spots. Previous owners had replaced a lot on it before me also supposedly did an engine rebuild also but time will tell. Only other issue besides the rust is the passenger window fights on its way up and needs an alignment. 

here she is after picking her up I plan to take more pics later this week.

 Reddit won't let me hyperlink the text so yeah ",2
Ford,"Looks stylin' and profilin'! I have a 2012 Focus (red), and I have to say I love this body style just as much.",1
Ford,"Hah no way. Our trucks are nearly identical haha. [Here are](http://imgur.com/a/xmb94) [two albums of my truck](http://imgur.com/a/hDQnQ)

I have a leveling kit, 130 amp alternator, ghetto cold air intake, header-back 3"" exhaust with a high flow cat and dynomax VT muffler, and I took the air dam off of the front bumper because it helps the approach angle and the P.O. had cut part of it up. I'm gonna wire some aux lights and put in front tow hooks over the summer and once my tires wear out I'm going to 33s. That's about it for upgrades for now. Obviously I'd like to do more but I don't have the time and I for sure don't have the money. 

Edit: Also I think your alignment is off in the front. ",2
Ford,Yes it does look like we are twins. And yeah it does need an alignment. That's the first thing I am doing tomorrow after getting a tag for it. My first upgrade will most likely be headers/exhaust with CAI. Will also put a tune on it. Down the road do gt40 heads + b303 cam.,2
Ford,"Yeah the stock exhaust is very restrictive. I think I kept the sub 2000rpm torque about the same but the truck really comes to life around 2800 all the way to 4500. As for the CAI, I would look into the 'ghetto K&amp;N' intake on www.fullsizebronco.com. I t is the same thing you would get from K&amp;N but you save a lot of money because you only buy the filter. As for the heads and cam, that's something that I want to do but I'm pretty sure you either have to convert to MAF or put in a quarterhorse tuner chip. The stock speed-density can only handle up to 300hp and with those mods you would be getting close to, if not surpassing the 300hp mark. 

Edit: Because it is not obd2, you cannot tune the stock computer. The quarterhorse is the only thing that you can use to tune it and I'm not quite sure it works but I know you have to open your ECU and plug it in somewhere. ",2
Ford,"My dad tuned my 90 mustang and tunes on the side. He will tune my truck he has some extra ones he can use. And yeah I know how it will get with tuning. I may even tune it myself gotta learn sometime. 

I will also look into that CAI",2
Ford,"I'm probably not great at explaining, but they're essentially tube chassis desert racers that are styled after factory pickups. They have (really) long-travel suspension, they're usually 2WD, and are powered by a v8. ANd they *usually* have A-arm independent suspension up front, 3 or 4-link with a solid axle out back.

So best way to put it, they're race trucks meant for hauling-ass across grueling desert terrain.

Ford,"All that said, it would be cool to see someone try and make an independent rear suspension like the Warthog from Halo lol. I don't know how practical it'd be, but it would be cool.

Ford,"How did he tune your mustang? Did he just use a standalone computer or did he use something like the quarterhorse? And yeah, it saved me a good bit of money. ",2
Ford,"Looking clean.

 Are blue cars like a theme on your side of the street? Lol",6
Ford,"Thanks! They tried to sell me a yellow one, and I was a little hesitant. Luckily they had literally just received this blue on in. It had 6 miles on it when I bought it!",1
Ford,"Thanks! Yeah, it's such a good body style!",1
Ford,Thank you!,1
Ford,Yes he used the quarterhorse to write to a chip which then stays in the computer.,2
Ford,"Oh cool. I haven't really looked into tuning my rig yet, that's why I'm asking. I will probably use a quarterhorse when I build a replacement engine. I might chose to convert to MAF though. It's not too hard to do from what I've heard.  ",2
Ford,"Just got it yesterday. You can see the plastic wrap still on the seats after the leather was treated at the dealership.

And I guess there are a lot of blue cars around.",2
Ford,"Haha maybe! I had an 04 cobra built 5.1 stroker, ported heads, custom cams, and a precision billet 8285 backed by a built th400 and 8.8 solid rear that made 1136 and my wife made me sell it because of our son. So needless to say going from having that As a fun toy to souly driving a 2007.5 silverado is AWFUL! ",1
Ford,I own a 2015 Mustang and I'm 100% sure the side mirrors can't do that. It's broken!,1

Ford,"EB I get around 16 combined. Best I ever see is around 18, worst is 15. All bets are off when towing - around 11. ",5
Ford,Yeah I was just looking at it a bit. Definitely gonna look into it more and weigh all my options.,1
Ford,Completely stock 2012 EcoBoost here. I drive about 32 miles on my commute to work round trip. 6 miles being city and 26 being 70mph expressway. I get about 18mpg normally. If I go on a long trip at around 65-70mph I normally see about 20.5mpg. ,4

Ford,"Yeah that's what I plan on doing. 300hp, 400lbft isn't very difficult to get out of these engines. The problem is that the E4OD takes about 20% out of the power made. I'm planning on switching to a zf5 once my transmission craps out or in a year or two. ",2

I average about 16-17 on my normal driving, which is mostly 30-45 mph around town and to work. On the highway at 70 mph, I get closer to 20. On extended periods of 55-60 mph, I normally average 21-22.",3
Ford,Ecoboost?,2
Ford,"Yes, sorry. I have it in my flair, but should have clarified.",2
Ford,"I have a 96 v6 mustang, and although it's older I still like it. But I'd honestly get the focus. But it's all up to you. ",1
Ford,So shiny!!,2
Ford,"late reply, but in answer to your question - any of those would be very expensive also. likely to be around $3500 for the year or more. engine size is a factor, as well as the 'insurance group', cars are given a rating between 1-50. with the lowest group being low HP, low value cars

the standard fiesta is in group 6 (very cheap), the ST is in group 30 (much more expensive if you're a teenager or haven't had a license for 2-3 years)",1
Ford,My dad has the 5.0 and my brother has the ecoboost. Both awesome vehicles,1
Ford,"I took the Eco boost challenge this past weekend. 
I fell in love with this car, seriously considering getting one. ",2
Ford,Is the 5.0 substantially lacking power compared to the Ecoboost in your opinion or is it pretty negligible?,2
Ford,2011 Ecoboost owner here.  Wish I had gone with the 5.0 - my plugs were pretty much done at 40k.  Sounds like that's pretty common.,2
Ford,There are some Ford techs who have been reporting that the ecoboost is showing a problem once it gets some miles on it that Ford doesn't know how to fix at this point. Allegedly carbon is building up on the back side of the intake valves and will eventually release and go into the turbo and cause damage to it. Ford is not doing warranty repairs on this at this point. For that reason and because of turbo lag I got an '14 with a 5.0 and absolutely love it. The torque is awesome. ,3
Ford,Great info. Thanks. I think I'm leaning toward the 5.0. ,2
Ford,"I had a 2012 FX4 Super Crew ecoboost and while I liked the power I never could truly feel comfortable with it.  I averaged 15.5 for the 45,000 miles I leased it and towing mileage stunk.  Walked away from it after my lease for a couple of reasons.  1-I don't trust the engine long term, i.e. plug issues and gas in the oil.  2- The transmission is suspect, super hard shifting, again long term trust. 3- You can't beat the sound of a V8.  I love Fords and have owned four F150s but I now drive a Tacoma.  Go V8 and don't look back.",5
Ford,My buddy has the 5.0 and uses it for towing. He's averaging 17 on interstates. The thing will pick up and go. Granted it's not as good as the EB but it's still pretty quick. ,3
Ford,Gotta love Ford blue.,1
Ford,"There are some in depth YouTube videos about it that have posted through here before within the last 3-6 months, but I don't have the link or title. ",2
Ford,"Thanks, I will take a look",1
Ford,"Yikes. I think insurance for a 19 y/o (me) with a 2014 Focus ST is like $1200/year. Minus good student discounts and such, but I'm glad it's not that bad. The U.S. sucks for importation laws, but you can definitely drive whatever you want here. ",1
Ford,They seem pretty much the same to me. I do like turbos but the sound of the 5.0 is awesome.,3
Ford,If you don't care about the power as much get the 5.0.  Much simpler design will last much longer.,3
Ford,I have a new 5.0. I am averaging 16.2 according to the productivity display. ,1
Ford,"I have a '14, 5.0 and over the 5,800mi I've put on it, I've averaged 17.5 mpg at around 70 mph. Daily commute is about 40 mi round trip, with about 36 being highway. I can average low 18's per tank when I'm doing a little more highway, and I've gotten up to 21.4 mpg pure highway keeping it at 65. The 5.0 is definitely no slouch when you put you put your foot in it. You probably won't notice that big of a difference between 5 hp and 10 lbs of torque. Maybe a bit in the mid range when the turbos finally kick in. But to me nothing beats the rumble of a V8. I put Borla exhaust on my truck to liven up the sound a bit and it sounds great. I wouldn't even think of putting an exhaust on a V6 truck because to me, they sound like a wet fart in tight denim. ",1
Ford,What's interesting is that I was getting 17 to 18 mpg out of the 2014 explorer and edge I rented for a few months. ,1
Ford,"I probably baby the throttle more than most other owners. I'm sure people hate coming off stop lights behind me, because I'm usually not ripping through the gears as soon as it turns green like the other cars next to me.",1
Ford,"in the US, is it true that if you're insured you can drive other peoples cars?",1
Ford,"Depends on your insurance and the other person's. If you have fully comprehensive insurance and the 3rd party vehicle is insured, I'm 99% sure you can drive another person's car.

That said, I would definitely carry my insurance card with me if I was doing that, and I think on some policies the minute you are no longer driving said car, the car is not insured, which is not good.",1
Ford,"see, I found this page as well. Any idea on what year(s)? I think it might be from an early 60s F series or mercury truck",1
Ford,"O2 sensor could've been knocked around when the manifolds were pulled off to swap the engines. Is there any change in sound from when the light came on? Cats don't generally just go bad, they can degrade but this sounds just like O2 sensor and a mechanic trying to screw you. What made you plop a new engine in if you don't mind me asking?",2
Ford,"I agree as well. I would go to your local parts store franchise (Oreillys, AutoZone, Napa, etc.) and they will usually hook up a scan tool for free and read your check engine light codes. Most of the time they should be able to tell you on the spot what the check engine codes are saying. I would try this before just putting more money into it.",2
Ford,"True, it should throw a code without an o2 sensor hooked up, definitely do that first op

Also why I have a Bluetooth obdii always pugged into my truck :)",1
Ford,"I have a 2013 Raptor. I've put around 22,000 miles on it...I drive it just about every day. The best parts: the looks from other guys in their trucks...I think it's envy...not sure...the growl of the exhaust...the acceleration...the not so good: it's WIDE! I mean like there are places you cannot go wide...sporting events...forget it...unless you don't mind door dings...the sound system...welll...I wouldn't use the touch screen too much...sounds great though...I had three Rams before this...I have a Corvette...this is my favorite vehicle ever...",0
Ford,"Truck sounds the same and runs good now. The truck initially went in for what we believed to be a bad Cam Phaser, which is known to be a problem with this year model. So the mechanic did $2000 of work to replace it but it still didn't fix the problem. He tried some other things but suggested that replacing the motor would be the best option. He dropped the $2000 of pervious work and charged us $5000 for the new motor. We've used this particular mechanic for the past 8 years and he's always been fair by us. I'm leaning towards the O2 sensor being the problem or just the fact that its a new motor and an old CAT that isn't working at it's peak efficiently. ",1
Ford,"You have the OBDII that connects to your phone using the Torque app? This is the one I use. It has a ton of useful information.

Ford,How does this work with you guys? Is it a courtesy delivery type thing? Do they actually order through the dealer? Do all the fun toys come installed or does your shop put the light bars on etc. ,2
Ford,"It is something to hear the ""secondaries"" I just sold my SHO today",2
Ford,"In this case, they were a special order from a dealer.


The Police Interceptor comes with some of the fun toys directly from Ford, like the AWD, heavier duty tires, brakes and suspension, spotlight, red/white dome light, etc.


The cars then get shipped to a company that outfits them with the majority of the rest of the equipment; although, sometimes the cars take multiple trips to several different shops before they're duty ready (e.g. computer shop for the radios and dash cam stuff, light shop for the... lights, interior shop for the custom fabbed cages for the rear seat and removal of interior rear door panels, etc.).",5
Ford,"Interesting, our shop works on the City's Police and EMS/Fire departments but I have yet to see any come in brand new. I have seen where brand new fire trucks are created in IL which is pretty cool. ",1
Ford,"That is an amazing beast of a vehicle. I hope you treated it right after prom, the girl too I guess.",2
Ford,"Oh I'm sure it would, but it's just like a GT500: it's not for everyone. They make the GTs in auto and they've got Titanium Foci in auto, that is enough. The hardcore cars should remain true to form. It would just ruin what the ST is and stands for. There's several Fords that should never be made with an auto: FoST, FiST, GT500, GT350/R, and the RS.

The fuel mileage ""can"" be better than the 5.0L as well if you keep your foot out of it, otherwise your turbos will spoon and eat your fuel mileage. Only issues my shop has seen with 5.0L was a valve issue, but it seems to be linked to the wonders not keeping up on mantence. Eco boosts now seems to be solid as well. The CAC water intake issue seems to be fixed on the 2014+ trucks. If your going to put aftermarket stuff on( lift large tires) I would suggest the 5.0L since you can get a very nice sound to match the look of a truck. An ecoboost with an exhaust kit on it just sounds funny to me.",3

Na it wasnt that bad at all. I know alot of these guy that have wiring issues with their Merks but I was lucky enough to not have much if any. They big issue I believe was the main harness is placed in a spot that get dumped on with water so after 15-20 years things happen. Also the driveshaft is 2 piece driveshaft which can be tough to find. Body parts are a pain to find as well.

The bed isn't huge and if you put a rack or tires back there to give it that off road look you loose space real quick. The rear can is huge when you put the seats up, even can fit bikes.

I don't think you understand how that market will evolve and the brand Ford caters to a certain customer base. I also don't see them strictly ruling out having the option to make the vehicle have a driverless feature but will always be able to drive the vehicle without it. I think it is a smart move as more and more insurance companies will want vehicles to be driverless when the technology gets good enough to have the data to prove that accidents occur a lot less with out a human behind the wheel.

Old gaskets and seals, old valve seals, it needs a valve job and timing chain. Realistically tops should be around $400 but it's your market, see what you can get. I'd offer $200 if I needed one. If 68 to 72 I'd go more, as it's better stuff. I would never consider taking a used motor and use it without taking it apart, cleaning everything and renewing whats needed. I just did this with a 4.6 and have $600 in it. If it's an econoline type it comes out the front. If it's a winnebago type it probably comes out the side, but was never designed to come out.

Soo ecobox tuners :)  I've had a mazdaspeed3 and this cobalt ss turbo, many friends with other cars and I put a preorder in on a RS. So I like my cars to be trackable and fun on the street. 

You are correct the SS is very under rated. Magazines etc still do not give it coverage, hell Chevy barely did. The supercharged won the time attack driven by then gmpp head john h. It destroyed everything. They had to take parts off as it was too fast. I have my SS track prepped with Powell racing parts, same guy(s) who did the cobalt time attack and a few Koni/conti cup ss's. The cars chassis and drive train is the best fwd in the U.S. For track. The fit and finish is lacking the creature comforts are lacking. But as a drivers car, you cannot beat it. Hell the resale is perfect for a buyer. I've had mine since new, only have 35k on a 2009. Never sees snow and barely rain. All I have is a downpipe, intake, and a gm stage 1 tune. I'll be getting the intercooler shorty. Just under 300 to the wheels and it spins all over, no real point going more power with all that torq.

The ms3 was a fantastic rig. I loved being able to haul stuff, but also track it. Stock for stock it was on par with a stage 2 supercharged ir stock turbocharged. Was not as capable on the track but held its own. The creature comforts and fit and finish were top notch. I freaking miss that car. You could raise/lower the hids with a switch. Interior was quality. The sound of the exhaust was beautiful, deep and throaty.  Best part was standard equipment was a LSD, which no other competitor has standard. The SS you have to make sure you got the g85 package.

I have a dd escape 2.0 ecoboost, same engine as the focus st. So I've been modding it and checking the focus forums. The 2.0 had a freaking tiny k03 single scroll turbo and some of the focus owners are a little high on how fast they think it actually is. The 2.0 with a k03 will take off quickly but that turbo is so damn small it looses breath in the top rpms and after 60 ish mph.  The new 2.0 in the 2015 edge and then newer fords I think goes with a twin scroll, but I don't remember. However the 2.3 in the RS will be a twin scroll, hopefully at least a k04 size. 

I give props to ford picking up some serious slack. I have spoken with guys in gmpp since the cobalt ss supercharged and they of course build and want cars like their Css but they haven't come to fruition. He mentioned the Cruze with the lnf was pretty fun :)",1

Ford,"Oh man I'm straight jelly that you're ordering the RS. That thing should be an absolute beast. For the longest time I ignored the Cobalt SS because I assumed it was one of those cars where they just slapped a performance badge on it to sell more (sorta like MOPAR putting a R/T badge on the Caravan). Then I watched the Regular Car Review on them and was taken back about how good it actually is.

I've driven an ST a couple times and there's no doubt that it's quick and the torque steer is noticeable. I think my favorite thing about the ST however is its gearbox. I think they probably put a single scroll on it because they were planning for the RS all along and needed enough difference between the two to justify it. And hopefully the RS lives up to the hype; but it should with AWD and over 300hp.

Ford,"One of my friends has a 2014 FX4 with the 3.5. We did a 21 hour road trip towing two cars, a crown vic going one way and a 86 bmw 7 series on the way back. It amazed me how great that V6 is at towing, I'm pretty sure towing the bmw it would beat my bronco in a 0-60. ",2

Ford,I had a similiar issue with my 2013 Ford Focus. It honestly sounds like the exact same problem. To be honest the problem just kind of fixed itself for me.

if you have something wrong with your vacuum lines, you will feel a ridiculously rough chug on your engine. there are a lot of hoses around too, so try this guys method to pinpoint the one. new hoses are dirt cheap. and honestly most shops dont charge very much for vacuum leak fixes.
",1
Ford,"Tell her to try 0000
",2
Ford,"Will do, thank you!",1
Ford,"Hi!

What size is your engine?

Have you located the DPFE on your engine yet? If you follow the vacuum lines out of either the EGR valve itself, or the EGR tube, it goes into a little box with 2 vacuum ports. That is your DPFE sensor.

Now that you've located it, is it all plastic, or does it have a metal backing to it? If its metal, it has never been replaced. They are notoriously defective, and have been redesigned. The replacement part has a list price of $111 from Ford.  REPLACE THIS FIRST. This is 99% of the problem for both of the codes listed.

After replacing, clear the codes, do a drive cycle. If the codes stay away, congrats, you are the 99%. If not, fail, you are the 1%. Spray the vacuum lines down with something non corrosive. You will see bubbles. Cut that section out, replace with HEAT TREATED VACUUM LINE. (Important note - each of the 2 rubber lines going into the dpfe have a different inside diameter, they are not both the same).

That will fix ya up.

Ford,"No need for an attorney my friend, contact your attorney general's office. In Mass and NH, where I worked extensively in state government, both AG's had an entire division to this. Since you seem quite competent, you surely have the paperwork (if you don't politely get the paperwork from the dealers for each visit) and give them a call. They should be able to handle things faster and cheaper than an attorney, if not entirely for free.

During the arbitration process you may ask for a refund of your rental car costs. Heavily document why you needed the features on your car to perform your job, and hence the upgrade was necessary. The arbitrator should agree with you. ",3

Ford,Thank you.  I live in CA and I have kept all receipts and paperwork from ford and taken pictures of all error messages and alerts on the car as well as the vehicle health reports.  I will contact the BBB if they aren't able to resolve it.  Today the lady I have been dealing with said she forwarded the case to her manager for review.  I'll wait and see what they come back with hopefully tomorrow.  In the mean time I am driving a Chrysler 200 from them which has no Bluetooth because I am afraid they won't cover the extra costs out of my pocket. ,2
Ford,"It's was taken to the dealerships and they said they could not reproduce the problem.  I would get the car back and it would work for a while then stop randomly.  Sometimes while driving on the highways, and sometimes pulling out of the driveway.   A couple of times it turned off in very dangerous places of the highway and I barely coasted to the side of the road.  Each time I had the vehicle health report which stated the problems. Specifically it was ""stop safely now"". Then the vehicle would just shut off completely.  The battery would show zero charge and even though it had plenty of gas in the tank I could not switch to gas mode so that to me ruled out a battery problem which they said it was originally. ",1
Ford,I have a ton of paperwork from them so I'm sure there is a case number in there somewhere.  I can take a look.  Is this something by one can look at somewhere online?,1
Ford,I live in CA.  I will check the BBB here.  I hope it might help resolve this.,1
Ford,"The BBB has absolutely no legal authority, they really are like an ""honors fraternity"" for business, and honestly the BBB doesn't really matter too much to business's reputation. However the attorney generals arbitrator's testimony can be used in civil cases down the line, so it can help drag what the dealer is doing out in the open, and it should scare Ford into being hit with a civil suit which would really damage their reputation. You could contact the press, but they were always hit or miss in my area. When I worked for a state senator fresh out of college we found a lawyer preying on veterans across state lines for millions of dollars. The family called us, but it had to be referred to the federal government. The family called the local news, but they turned it down. I was surprised, it seemed like a juicy story, but may since it is Ford they will be interested as it will pull in results.

The Chrystler 200 looks like a nice car, but I was shocked talking to friends who bought cars (I'm a few years out of college, new cars at this age is a big thing). I was surprised how many features came on the Focus. ",2
Ford,It's a nice car but nothing like the fusion.  It's completely barebones.  I really did love the fusion when it was working.  I think the biggest problem with this whole thing was the lack of in house services.  It seems everything is being outsourced by ford. From the loaner/rental cars to the risk management. ,1
Ford,"Both of them do. One is a 1924, and the other is a '66.",1
Ford,At least they are fixing it right away. My 2009 Impala has the same issue with the ignition that my 1998 Grand Prix had. ,6
Ford,"I went from a 2005 limited to a 2015 titanium. I've also owned a 2005 xls. 

The new gen does have less rear cargo room and the hatch doorframe is smaller. I could fix 4x4 sheets of sheet rock and plywood in the old escape. Not the new one. However 10' 2x4 or copper pipe still fit.

The new gen feels sooo much better, drives smoother, nice features and interior. The old gen feels more off road/rugged. As for seat comfort, I don't fully understand. The old seats were more squishy, the new seats are the new common standard, slightly firm but adjustable. 

I do miss the rear door opening, rear glass opening, ride height feel and ruggish looks, and lift kits available, but the new escape is quiet, easy to drive, hell of a mpg upgrade, faster and comfortable. I can see why people prefer the old gen, but you need to sit and drive a new one and see if you like it...",2
Ford,"&gt; I have offerend them every chance to make this right. Am I wrong in expecting that I at least get a loaner car which has bluetooth?

Unless specifically outlined in some agreement or service contract or your warranty you are not *entitled* to a loaner of any kind, let alone one with matching features. 

That does not mean it isn't good business to do so. As someone who has worked in the service dept too, let me ask that you dont take it out on the advisor. If they could give you what you want, they would. They want to get to work selling too and not running damage control all day. 

I have seen in the past, this was for dodge though, a customer pay the difference on their rental upgrade and then submit the paperwork to Chrysler showing all their charges and ROs confirming it was down in the shop and still be worked on. Chrysler reimbursed them for 80% of the difference and gave them free oil changes good at any dealership for 3 years.

Ford,I will settle this for you once and for all......F150 all the way!!,0
Ford,Apparently in some states the BBB can be given the authority (by the mfr) to facilitate a buyback.,1
Ford,wat,1
Ford,"&gt;  but if i can get the same mileage from a newer/nicer truck, then i'm all for it!

Absolutely!  That Ranger was useless for towing, the F150 was so completely stable and planted by comparison.  Not to mention the 4.0L SOHC's reputation for spitting out timing chains",1
Ford,"If you have not talked to Ford customer service, you need to. 1 (800) 392-3673. Assuming you have not since you do not have a case number. ",2
Ford,I've never had any problems with other manufacturers with loaners.  I agree but I would think it's just good business practice to offer something to someone who had problems from the second day they owned the car.  They really have lost me as a customer unless they turn things around somehow. ,1
Ford,"Interesting, it must be an agreement between the business and the BBB then. I've never heard of this, but private arbitration doesn't seem like a bad idea",1
Ford,"Yeah, it's basically Ford saying they don't have time to deal with this shit and it's cheaper to endure a few outcomes that don't go their way than to handle it all themselves.",1
Ford,"Ford introduced the new 2016 Mustang. Considering that in the 2015 Ford completely redesigned the Mustang, this time the American iconic car received minor changes, combined with new packages and trim options.",-3
Ford,Looks like you put a lot of work into that site... ,0
Ford,"Yes please. 

(to both the car and the woman)",0
Ford,"Absolutely Right! They **should** offer you a loaner but not because you are *entitled* to one but because it is good business and keeping the customer happy is always the right thing to do. **BUT** your question was if you were *entitled* to one and the answer to that question is a resounding no. (Barring something like a service contract or stipulation in your warranty that says otherwise)

As a word from the inside, often the dealership can get some compensation from the factory for covering a loaner too. Often the factory will cover 5 days or so and the dealership may be willing to cover a few days out of their own pocket. But in order for the dealership to cover it they have to submit it as part of a covered warranty repair, basically another add on when they submit for payment on their warranty repairs. No warranty repair submitted, no way to get paid for that loaner. 

So if they aren't able to find anything wrong, they cant submit for reimbursement from Ford. So all the time they are paying their tech to try and figure out whats wrong with you car, including having them drive it around to try and get it to happen, is all money out of their pocket. So they are already out a bunch of money most likely trying to fix your car. And even if they do figure out what is wrong and they do fix it completely. Ford will most likely only pay them the book time to complete the repair and maybe a half hour to an hour diagnostic time for figure it out, even if they had the tech driving your car for 3 days or messing with it trying to figure out what was wrong for hours. Diagnostic time does not get paid as straight time from the factory. 

So keep that in mind, they are spending money on you to try and fix your car. And if they do figure it out and do fix it, then you will most likely be able to submit your rental bills to ford for reimbursement, probably not more than $30 a day (which is the industry standard rental coverage) but they may decide to cover more than that or even all of it. But you honestly will have a chance to get something. 

The dealership however will get an emphatic no to their request for reimbursement for your rental if they cover it. 

I hope that at least sheds some light on the inner workings of what the people trying to help you are dealing with. ",1

Ford,"Yes, that's normal, its not necessarly telling you that the battery is low, but at that point it thinks that you have left the key on and are no longer in the vehicle due to the long period of time so it shuts accessories off to prevent a low battery. ",1

Ford,Dude why not get a better head unit? Go somewhere like best buy and get something that will be a huge upgrade. Maybe get some front speakers too,1

Ford,"Please read this as I went through the same thing (except with Chrysler and a Jeep Grand Cherokee)

If a vehicle goes in for repair on the same item more than 3 times it's considered a Lemon under the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act.

Personally I got a lawyer that specializes in it and let them take care of it.   Chrysler didn't want to go to court so I got the option of  1) Vehicle buyback and my money back  or 2) Keep the vehicle with a cash settlement.     I actually ended up doing #2 and paying off the vehicle (I also fixed it myself (AC Blend doors)).

Trust me, if you can show proof with the paperwork that it's gone in multiple times for the same issue and it can't be fixed, it's time to get a lawyer and get this done.  Without legal representation you'll just get blown off by Ford (or any manufacturer for that matter)",1

He does seem to love it though and I have a lot of fond memories driving it out to lake Erie with the top down, wife sitting in the bench seat next to me, listening to old AM radio stations (there are very few that play music though, so it was always hard finding something to listen to).    I feel obligated to see that car through the next generation since I've had it so long and like me, it's a product of the 60s so there's that :/ 

My plans are to put a modern Ford v8 in it -- maybe a Coyote or a Marauder drivetrain (much more modern engine that doesn't kill trees when I start it, maybe get something like 20-25 highway instead of 15).   I'd also like a modern sound system and some working A/C.   I'm leaving the leaky top design alone though.  Let one of my grandkids figure out that you can't take it through a car-wash at least one time on their own :)  Yeah, I did it once back in 91, with laughable results.

You can do it too: just save up your money and try to book hotels in advance (they're cheaper that way, unlike what I did). Also, try to plan to trip around days that you would have off of work anyways that way you won't miss too much. All in all I probably spent around $500 for the whole trip.",1

They routinely peruse the user boards (vbulletin forums, reddit, twitter, etc). Theres a few numbers you can call/email  at corporate that are looking for situations like these.

Trust me, the dealers DO NOT like it when you circumvent them and try to get help from corporate. By your description it definitely sounds like it is time to attempt something they will not like.

Talking about a lawyer vs a lawyer reaching out officially is not the same thing, hence why they are treating you this way. Add to the fact we're talking LA county dealers here and I am not surprised by their response. They can still commute in their cars everyday, try the corporate route and if all else fails?

Ford,It was just announced the other day.  The last governor raised all of the tolls by at least 250% each.  One of the first things this one has done was to lower the tolls.  He just approved 30 mil to go to a new youth jail and denied 11 mil to go to Baltimore schools yesterday.  I'm not sure what interest he is working for.  ,1

Having said that, though it's kind of irrelevant, I absolutely love your generation Edge, looks wise, I've never been in one. But they sure look great. Looks wise, I like the Edges, but mechanically, Ford could only hope to be as good as honda, not better.

I'd have a much harder time trading from a '13 though. Dat widebody.",1

Ford,"I don't recall exactly what the daytime running lights on your Edge look like, but a lot of LED lights on many different makes of modern vehicles are switchbacks; they turn off the running lights either completely or on the side of the signal light to make the signal light more obvious!

Ford,"That's what I was trying, I think the knob was starting to come apart. So I left  it and decided to try again later. ",1
Ford,Bring it in one of the sensors is probably acting up,1
Ford,"she was fun, but the fiesta is way more affordable and still have a blast with it",1
Ford,"So, did you already pick up the ST? I'd love to see what you do to it once you have it, you seem to have great taste in mods. So far I picked up a Ford OEM leather/aluminum shift knob for my ride, not sure where I'll go from there, but I'm gonna keep 'er slow.",1

Ford,"It's called a switchback system.  Nearly all cars with dedicated running lamps do this.  I'd imagine it's too really poinyt out you've got a blinker on,  for safety or visibility or whatever",1
Ford,"Start looking at cars when you're driving, you'll notice it's a pretty common feature. I struggle to call it a feature, but it's often there. If I'm not mistaken, it's a federal regulation that during the day, the lights have to be dimmer than the turn signals.",1
Ford,"Interesting. I've never noticed them before. I just found a setting to turn off Daytime Running Lights, so I just turned them off. Problem solved. Haha",1
Ford,"Depending on your insurance you can actually get a discount for having daytime running lights enabled in your vehicle :) it's not much, usually only a couple of bucks.",3
Ford,"I'm a headlamp engineer for Nissan. This is an SAE and ECE regulation. If the DRL is within 100mm of the turn signal source, the turn signal has to be at least 2.5x as bright as the DRL. DRL's have to be very bright because of these same regulations which makes turn signals very difficult to get that bright. Because of this, most OEMs just turn off the DRL to comply with the regulations.",9
Ford,Bought my 1st and 2nd Mustang there.,1
Ford,"They have a white 50th Anniversary GT on the showroom floor. I haven't historically been a Mustang guy, but damn does it look good.",1
Ford,"That sounds like an interesting job, would you be ok with sharing the kind of work that you do day-to-day?",1
Ford,"Most likely one of the sensors is failing, it is possible that there will be a code even if the system is working at that time, but it is not 100%. And of course if there is just a code and the system is working fine replacing a sensor is just a guess at that time. Best thing is to just bring it in and see what they have to say. ",1
Ford,This wont work. The whole system shuts off if it sees a fault in one sensor. ,1
Ford,Not sure why you would want to do that (some states even require them on new cars),2
Ford,"All of the newer vehicles are doing this now, my moms Durango does this too, nothing to worry about.",1
Ford,Me too.  I bet it looks great.  It's hard resisting the urge to upgrade. ,1
Ford,Would you be able to use a jumper wire in order to trick the system into thinking there's a good working sensor in place that's not seeing anything in front of it? Or have they made these sensors more complicated than that? ,1
Ford,"Now that I think about it, if the sensors can report how far away something is, I'm sure they work off variable voltage or variable resistance and you would need to know the tech specs on the sensors.. That makes it quite a bit more difficult to diagnose. ",1
Ford,"No a jumper wire will not work, definitely more complicated than that. There are 4 or 5 wires going to each sensor. ",2
Ford,"Sure. I'm currently working on prototypes for the 2016 Infiniti QX60 headlamps and fog lamps. Most of what I do is making sure quality is up to our standards by looking at gaps and things like that. Most of my job is finding solutions for issues that come up in prototype stages and finding the most cost effective as well as performance effective designs. A lot of it is keeping our suppliers in line with all of our deadlines and requests and basically making sure they're delivering to the best of their abilities. Because we're the customer, I am essentially their boss when it comes to setting schedules and requesting studies and design changes. A lot of the final decisions are made by styling management (designers that draw but don't have a technical background) or purchasing management (basically accountants), but I function as the front line for deciding between designs and solutions. They approve (or decline) my decision, but they only see what I choose as the best proposal. Sometimes its cool because I can make pretty major styling and engineering changes if someone calls out an issue and a major change is the only solution. They're typically too busy to come up with solutions on their own so they have to use my proposals. 

I also work on other exterior parts. For the Nissan Leaf, I do pretty much the entire exterior except for the metal parts. All the exterior lights, cowl cover, windshield wiper and washer fluid tanks. Theres a bunch more stuff but that project is pretty quiet right now so I don't do much on it.

The cool thing is that anything I work on I have sole responsibility for once its been handed over by our Japanese or American designers. There's plenty of help if I need it, but I am the only point of contact in the whole world for these parts. This means a big part of my job is just knowing what is going on with these parts. My management is too busy to keep track of every issue and design change for all my parts so I only fill them in on major high level issues and changes.",1
Ford,That is my favorite body style. I have been keeping my eye out for an F150 like that for a while. ,1
Ford,Very cool! You must be proud seeing your work on the road. I always wondered how that balance between engineering practicality and the wishes of the designers works out. Thanks for the reply.,1
Ford,"Yeah, its definitely rewarding seeing your work on the road. Its actually why I took the job. I had other offers but none with the responsibility of this one. I love having maximum design responsibility with minimum oversight.",1
Ford,Try to get something before the new body style change that happened somewhere between 2011-2012. See a lot of issues with torque converters and air conditioning systems on the new ones. ,2
Ford,"The 2nd gen (Pre-2013) are great little vehicles. Its the same as any used car, buy on condition. If it's been taken care of it's as good as anything else. The only real recurring issue with them is rust where they use salt on the roads and the front crank seals on the v6 models (VERY quick and easy fix). I would have absolutely no issue with owning a 4 cylinder from those years (I have a really long commute)",1
Ford,"2013 is the new body style. It seems like the 14's are the problematic ones, and of course any of them with the 1.6 Ecoboost, I've seen 2 of those engines warrantied out in our shop in as many months.",1
Ford,"The yellow part? Yes, mine fell off when I took it to get an oil change and somehow they lost the part. I had to reach my hand under the hood and pull the metal strip to the left with my hand to release the latch. GOD, I still wish I had that car.",2
Ford,"Interesting, I still have to go see what the hell happened to it, because I have no idea how to open it now. ",1
Ford,I like that Ford is doing its part to help people learn how to drive a manual. ,4
Ford,"TBH, it's a 96. Thing's are/have been deteriorating after repeated use so this will continue happening. You can't point at one thing and say ""If you hadn't opened my hood this thousandth time the latch would still be there"" and expect someone to pay for it. It could've fallen off going to down the road after the oil change for all you know. ",1
Ford,"I was glad that Ford set up a ""Shiftphobia"" area for people to learn stick shift. I admit, the guy looks funny posing on the practice pedals, but it is a good way to show people how it is done before they take to the road. I learned how to shift early and enjoy manual transmissions, especially on the open road. It is good to see that Ford is doing its part to save the manuals.",3
Ford,"2009-2012 is a solid vehicle, heck both my 2005's were solid. For mpg you may want to spring for the 4cylinder unless you need to tow. 

Otherwise my dad has a 2.0 awd 2014 titanium and I have a 2015 2.0 awd titanium with no issues. 

If you go used, pay the $100 or so and bring the vehicle to a trusted shop and have them give it a full look over. They can find a heck of a lot more of the bad things than you can laying on the ground.",1
Ford,"Get down and pull up the hood as far as it will go latched.  From the center of the latch, look to the left of it and you'll see a flat metal strip.  Just put your hand under the metal strip and grasp it and pull it to the left and that should release the latch and you'll see where that the yellow part went. There should be 2 little holes where the yellow part inserts but I don't know how you keep it in place. ",1
Ford,"It just caught me as strange when I saw it. Thought something was wrong. But that's been laid to rest that it is indeed, normal behavior.",1
Ford,Yeah same thing happened to me when I first noticed it.,1
Ford,Definitely want to see some people's setups with stock wheels,1
Ford,"2012 appears to be the last model year. 

""On December 22, 2011, the last USA-built Ranger rolled off the St. Paul, Minnesota assembly line.[1]""

More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ranger",3
Ford,"From what I've heard, Ford's official reasoning was that many people who bought Rangers were just looking for inexpensive, basic transportation and in that case they would push them towards the new Fiesta. and another major group that bought Rangers were businesses and in that case the dealers would push them towards the new transit connect. 

But I believed the real reason Ford discontinued the truck was that it was very dated, basically unchanged since 1992. And the federal government's CAFE fuel economy standards put a lot of protections for big trucks and really increased the standards for vehicles with small wheel bases like cars and small trucks. and rather than sell the larger, redesigned international ranger that would have to meet much higher fuel economy standards and risk cannibalizing F-150 sales, Ford decided to cut production. ",6
Ford,Ford made more margin selling a v6 f150 than a v6 ranger. Guide your loyal customer base to a higher margin product = $$$$,2

Ford,"I'd imagine so, they put a programme into the ECU that will do wonderful things. ",1
Ford,"The problem is, I believe, in the software controlling the dual clutch actuation. Other than its annoyance, you aren't doing any damage besides accelerating clutch wear, which won't matter when you get it replaced in three months. I hear the fix improves, but doesn't solve the problem, and it isn't going away soon. It takes a long time for Ford and Getrag to engineer and manufacture an all new transmission, so if you ever buy another 12-17MY Focus in the future, do yourself the favor and buy one with a manual trans. ",2
Ford,"You can find new ones on eBay. You owners manual will explain the procedure to program them to your car. If it is the kind where the key and fob are integrated, you will have to have the keys cut and program them to your vehicle as well. ",1
Ford,"As I understand it, the issue is all from a transmission input shaft seal. The seal weeps a bit, causing clutch contamination. Then you get shudder. After the shudder starts, a software upgrade will make the shifts more firm to compensate. If it gets too bad, the slippage exceeds a threshold and you get engine shutdowns/check engine lights. 

Driving it will only hurt the clutch. Remember this is an automated manual, not a true automatic. Slippage is excessive clutch wear. Your replacement seal/clutch will get you pretty close to brand new. ",3

Ford,"If the item can be shown to be the cause of the failure, then they can void that portion of your warranty. For example, if you put a CAI on the car then drive through some water and hydrolock the engine, you will be buying a new engine, but you'd still be covered under the warranty if your wheel bearing or radio or whatever failed.",2
Ford,"Oh man, so jealous of your SAP",1
Ford,"Most websites' part checkers won't tell you anything other than stock.  Go to the tire store, or check a forum.  My 86 bronco is running stock Alcoas with 33 r15 10.5 KM2s IIRC, but 12 is more common.  ",1
Ford,"I've got a 2014 Focus Sport. I've done numerous mods: CAI, Short throw lever, short throw bracket, snorkel delete, HID retrofit headlights, etc. As long as you get the parts from respectable companies (i.e. FSWerks or Steeda) you won't have problems. You can't void your warranty with mods. As u/nikkistl mentioned, if an aftermarket part is proven to cause the problem (like his example of the CAI) then you'll cover that single repair on your own. But if your transmission goes then it'll be covered under warranty. But just so you're aware, experiencing hydrolock is usually seen with a true CAI. A true CAI is one that moves the intake from up in your engine bay down to somewhere where the air is cooler. Usually this means moving the intake down near the front left wheel somewhere in the front fender. This is where hydrolock is most experienced. As far as I know, they don't make true CAIs for our MKIIIs yet. I have one on mine and have driven through very heavy rain and it was fine. 

To sum it up, I wouldn't be worried about any aftermarket parts that are simple bolt-ons: CAI, short throw shifters, sway bars, motor mounts, springs, coilovers, catbacks, etc. Also I would just make sure they are from trusted companies: Steeda, FSWerks, Rebel Devil, The Lighting Firm, etc.

Sway bars and wheel bearings will go out on any car with enough miles on it. The real concern is the transmission. If you can find a car that's had its transmission fluids taken care of without too many miles on it. I'd go for it!

Ford,Gm makes the Le Mans vette... That's super right? ;) ,1
Ford,I make decent money for just coming out of college and I've got a '14 Focus Sport.....now I'm looking at the ST with hungry eyes lol,1
Ford,Dammit I'm 23 and I can't even afford one of those! Off to go drive my 89 Lil ranger....,3
Ford,I live in Alberta and kids buy diesels all the time here cause they get a job on the rigs. But when they get laid off those trucks are right back at a dealership. ,5
Ford,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, because it's true. I'm 23 and I work an office job as a consultant. I don't make near $100,000/year (more like half that), and I'm college educated and live in a pretty metropolitan area. I've only been working for one year because I spent the other four years since 18 in college, digging myself into a hole.

One of my buddies from high school though, he moved to North Dakota at 18 and started working the oil fields. He's been working for 5 years now (four more than me), and makes four times as much with no college degree (he makes about $230,000 per year, or at least he was before oil prices tanked).

There's tons of money in the oilfields, but I can do this job for 40 years. My friend could do his job for 40 years as well, but he will be pretty beat to hell. It's very demanding work that he does.

He could probably save money and retire way before me, but unfortunately it seems that neither he nor any of his buddies are fiscally responsible. ",4
Ford,There's no way he got that loan without a cosigner so don't feel too bad. It helps to have wealthy parents.,3
Ford,Rangers are great trucks.,3
Ford,Don't forget about your cosigner. There's no way anyone would loan an 18 year old $40K+ without a cosigner who had good credit.,2
Ford,"I have a buddy that is the same way. Blew his money. Then when prices tanked and had no work he sat at home posting how he wants oil prices to be $100-150 a barrel. I tried explaining to him that he's an idiot and that he wouldn't be working at those prices due to the low amount if people who would be willing to buy it at that price and how no one would be able to drive due to gas prices. But he was convinced if it was that high they would be drilling like crazy because they would want to be selling it. He didn't comprehend the fact hardly no one if any wild be buying at those prices. He make money, but it's because he can lift heavy things, not because he is smart. 

Not to mention your job is relatively stable and safe, you are educated and move along to another job if needed. If they have one injury that hinders them, it's back to trying to find a job they can do with no education. ",3
Ford,I love Rangers,2
Ford,Me too but I would like a truck that's younger than me and can tow a trailer with a vehicle on it. But I'd never get rid of my ranger.,2
Ford,That is a real lineup!!!!!!,1
Ford,While thats cool and all if you own a truck and tow trailers you better know how to do it without this technology.  ,2
Ford,"Apologies for the sideways pic.

You think society would sort of just stop because filling up your car is expensive. 


You are not so smaht.

This shit is hard and requires problem solving capabilities that jo blow cubicle guy only wishes he had. 

I have a degree and am fucking killing it but there are people without degrees who have very high positions in the oilfield because of their experience. 

You obviously don't know what you are talking about so stop spouting off at the mouth and enjoy your meager salary and your impending lackluster retirement. ",-5
Ford,You need to spend some time with a supply and demand chart. ,1
Ford,Wait for the RS.  You'll regret buying an ST once the RS is released.,2
Ford,Oh sure but I won't be able to afford a $30-35K car. I'll be able to snag a close-to-new ST for less than $20K. But what I might end up doing is waiting until the RS has been out for a year or two and some used ones start to show up.....,1

Ford,A few years out of college I think I had more money. As time goes on buying power has dropped. Damn it!,1
Ford,"rodbuster90,

I think you should be ok, as Ford recently extended the warranty on pretty much all of the components of the DCT. I'm guessing you took it in to an independent shop and got a diagnosis. Keep in mind those shops likely have little experience with something like Ford's dual clutch transmissions and may be giving you an incorrect assessment on your car. This transmission has been troublesome enough where pretty much any Ford dealer most likely has at least one mechanic in the bay who is familiar enough with the DCT. My local dealer has one technician solely dedicated to replacing the troublesome components in the Fiesta and Focus. 

My advice would be to drive the car as little as possible since you're nearing the 60,000 mile cut-off. Although I think if you raise enough stink at Ford corporate you should get them to make an exception in your case should the dealer try to charge you any money for whatever repairs you might need. You might also be able to get refunded for however much you spent at the other mechanic for a diagnostic. 

[Here](http://www.focusfanatics.com/forum/mk3-tsb-recall-problems-archive/455833-ford-dual-clutch-warranty-extension-details-new-tsb-clutch-parts.html) is a thread on Focus Fanatics dedicated to the warranty extension you should check out. You might want to also create an account there and establish a relationship with Ford Service on the forum, as they're pretty active on that site and could potentially help you out if you encounter an issue with the dealer. If you truly think the car is unsafe to drive, I would see if you could get a rental car, although I'm not sure how your local dealer handles something like that, or if you're entitled to one under the warranty. If your car is drivable then it is likely that its some components of the transmission itself and not the whole assembly itself. Finally, if you feel like the dealer is not being helpful, you might want to consider going to another Ford dealer to get the work done. 

Hope this helps.

Ford,Thanks man!! I appreciate it ,1
Ford,Thanks! I had to search until I could find someone who would do it in California ,1
Ford,True! And I am only paying 18 for it. Once I get some income coming in I can apply for a loan at my unions credit union,1
Ford,Agreed! ,1
Ford,I'll be stopped at a red light and when it turns green and I accelerate the engine will rev up but I won't go anywhere.  Its like I'm in neutral but I'm in drive. Also just the grinding and the stuttering but that has been happening eversince I got the car.,1
Ford,"I made an appointment with the local dealer and they said to drop it off Tuesday and give them a couple days to see if it really is the transmission that's giving me the issue (duh). They said I am covered through the power train warranty for the transmission.  I will head over to the forum and ask around. Thank you for your response. I'm just hoping the dealership doesn't try to screw me just to get me over the 60,000 mile mark for it to break again so I can't use the warranty. Or maybe I'm mistaken on how the warranty works. Idk. I'm just scared.",1
Ford,"I understand you're upset. I would be too. I follow everything related to the DCT because I own a Focus as well and want to stay up to date on any changes to the warranty. From what you've described in your comment below it sounds like your TCM is on the fritz, which should be covered no problem under the warranty. I would definitely check out the Focus Fanatics forum and read whats been posted about all this. Please let us know how you make out.",1
Ford,"its 5 years 60k, you are still in warranty... 

its like anything else in life it can break. 

besides you should have 2 programs and letters mailed to you that extend the trans controller for 7 years or 100k and cover the clutch for 10 years 150k. ",1
Ford,"600 is kinda of on the low side...

Small world!!!😛",3
Ford,"The symptom of feeling like you're stuck in neutral sounds like the exact same problem my own Focus had a couple months ago 2012 @75k. The problem fixes itself when you power cycle the car? On my car, the dealer replaced the TCM under warranty, which has just been extended to 100k for the TCM, as wackywabbit said. ",1
Ford,"Well, nevermind. 

I tried a different USB drive and it seemed to pick up the files and is currently installing them. I was previously using a 16GB USB drive (not a cheap/free one, but a Kingston DataTraveler, mind you) and the one that seemed to work was a cheap/free 4GB one I found somewhere. 

Go figure. Now I'm sitting in the car, on a Friday night, with my laptop, watching the files install. ",2
Ford,That'll buff out.,3
Ford,"haha, someone finally caught me!  Nice.",1
Ford,"Pay attention!!!!!

Okay. So here's the deal. I'll tell you what the technician at the Ford dealership will do. I can tell you this because I'm one of the guys that he will call when he can't figure it out. Since it neutrals, stumbles, and grinds, they'll perform what's called an Adaptive Relearn. This will give the TCM a chance to relearn all of the operating parameters that it uses to make this unique piece of magic to work. This process clears all of the learned KAM from the module and is essentially a reset for the TCM. If that doesn't help, they'll take a fluid sample based on the grinding noises (if it is indeed coming from the transmission) to inspect it for debris. If debris is present, removal and disassembly will be required. 

If the issue is with the clutch or clutch system, and no debris was present, there will be a warranty extension available as an FSA. The grinding noise present can be a result of a fault with the clutch. If the clutch isn't/doesn't/can't fully disengage, then the input shaft will obviously be spinning and can make the next gear engagement have an issue. The next concern comes if they decide they have to replace the clutch. Immediately let them know you'll need assistance with the rental vehicle you'll have to get. The clutches are on backorder for eight to twelve weeks. That's not Ford's fault btw, the supplier can't supply for the demand. 

The large amount of clutch replacements isn't necessarily always due to a clutch fault. If the rear main leaks and the engine oil gets on the clutch, boom! Replacement required. If release bearing grease gets on it? Pow! Replacement required. 

This transmission (called a DPS6, DPS, or PS195) is extremely unique and is quite honestly some awesome technology. People bad mouth it for all the problems it seems to run into but there is almost no other transmission out there that is like it. Very few. Even with as much diagnosis as I provide these transmissions, I love them for their innovation and sheer technical awesomeness. 

Please take note, I am not acting in this comment on behalf of Ford Motor, Co. Merely providing some information to some inquiring minds :).

Edit: also, I would very highly recommend never ever ever taking this vehicle to an independent shop for a transmission issue. As someone else already recommended. ",1

If you pull the transmission dip stick, is it red/pink? Or is it brown/black and smell?


First the transmission on the 1at hen was sensitive, I would recommended never flushing it. You will however want to drain and fill. Works similar to an engine oil change. There is a drain plug under and you fill via the dip stick. The automatic should drain 3.x quarts. 

As for down on power, this could be all the main little things, iac valve, pcv, clean the maf, spark plugs, intake filter, throttle position sensor. ",2

I used to have a 1980 Fiesta, and would always check out others I saw in parking lots. One day I came across another that had an automatic transmission that had been retrofitted into it. The lady driving it had no idea that it had been added in because she had bought the car used it it was already there. The same might be the case with this car, if it was purchased this way. 

While it looks cool, I wonder what it did for the structural integrity of the car. The roof does a lot to help keep cars from flexing, particularly in corners. If additional bracing wasn't added, now that I think about it, it might be more terrifying than fun to drive.

Ford,What rack are you using? I'm looking for one for my '14 hatch.,1
Ford,"1) You can get them from aftermarket places like The Lighting Firm or you can order them from Ford (pretty sure). You should be able to actually go into your dealer and order them. I don't know exactly what you need to do but there will be some wiring and possibly fuse tapping in order to get them to work. Personally I'd suggest going over to FocusFanatics.com and seeing how those guys did it. There are a ton of people who retrofit their SE's with fog lamps and a lot of them have posted how-to's.

2) I recently looked into this because my Focus Sport didn't have the 6 month free trial like a lot of Fords do. So basically in order for your car to be able to activate Sirius there has to be something already installed (I can't remember exactly what it is that it needs). So if your car doesn't come with that then you can't activate it. It's hard to explain but your manual explains it a lot better.",2

Yeah so JD Power =not super objective and it can miss the value of a SUV like this. I find the Escape is a bit of a diamond in the rough, meaning: if you prevent these three things, this might be the best car ever:

•	Transmission cooler leak

•	Transmission shaft leak (mostly left side half shaft)

•	Rear window water leak

Check these parts are in good working order and seal up the rear window and you have eliminated 80-90% of any potential future problems.

The new engines in the 09-12 have a bit more HP and MPG the other duratecs AND the newer 6 speed 6F35 is (reportedly) much improved over the CD4E 4 speed trans.

I'm a Service Engineer with the Ford Technical Assistance Center (fancy name for I work on the Ford Hotline, shutup and let me have my moment). As such, I gotta say that I'm commenting on my own behalf and none of what I'm about to say comes from Ford or represents Ford's opinions, they're all my own. Also, you're doubly in luck b/c my focus is Transmissions and Drivelines. 

Now on to the meat and potatoes. The half-shaft leak that you've probably heard of is only a small issue with the AWD models, not so much with the FWD. And there aren't any recurring issues with the cooler leaking. Unfortunately I can't speak for the window sealing concern as I'm not in the Body/Chassis group so whatever you've heard is probably a better guess than I could give. 

The 6F series of transmissions is rather good and a lot better than the old CD's. They're in pretty much everything that isn't a truck or transit. There's the 6F mid-range that's in the smaller vehicles and then there's the bigger, beefier cousin 6F50/55 that comes in models with a little more get up and go. 

There has been an issue with the torque converter clutch not being engaged/disengaged properly but it's only a recurring thing that we SE's notice. The other engineering branches haven't been concerned with it and there is no recalls/TSBs/SSMs or internal messages about them. 

All in all, the Escapes are wonderful. If it were me, I'd try to go with a `10 or `11 but that's my personal preference and you don't have to listen. I don't feel like I provided that much information but I hope it was helpful somehow lol.",3

Ford,"Had a ~600whp 2007 GT500 for a year (did the mods myself) - did the 2013 TVS + CAI + Tune, bumped the stock HP about 125hp.

A few thoughts after driving it around for a year like that:

* 1. This was a wonderful mod, really woke the car up.
* 2. I should have done the cooling system as well because in the summer the difference between 110 degree afternoon drive in traffic (Arizona) and 70 degree morning fresh start _felt_ like 150 HP difference... I have no idea what it really was, but it was DRASTIC.
* 3. Getting to 650HP is pretty easy and gives you enough power you are going to smoke the tires in 1st and 2nd. Getting &gt; 650hp starts getting expensive exponentially... to wacky's point -- sure, you can do 800, but now you are dropping some SERIOUS money to get there.

Twin-turbo is cool, if you can stick with quick-spooling turbos to get your boost online early (2k or lower) go for it. If you can't get them to spool until like 3500, then I think you miss out a bit on a fun RPM range.

If you can get into an already boosted one, liek the GT500 so you can just ""go bigger"" that's an easy way to start VS starting with naturally aspirated and then needing to change out everything under the hood -- but PLENTY of people do it, so maybe a non-issue... I just found my mods trivial to do because 'everything was already sitting there'.

Ford,First thing I would do is get new plugs.  Make sure you have good spark.  Then make sure there is no squirrel nest in the intake.  New air filter and take that assembly apart up to the throttle body and make sure it is all clean.,1
Ford,Do you smell gas after cranking a while?,1
Ford,"Chances are if it's a '98, it needs brakes/shocks/struts/bushings/etc., among other things (belts, hoses, plugs, coolant and trans fluid changes). These cars were bought mainly by cheap people that did the least amount of maintenance possible. 

That said... 

If you can't afford $35 for a shop manual, the car is probably not roadworthy, and shouldn't be driven until you get a job and can service it properly. Ride a bike until the car is safe to use around other motorists. 

Getting it ""running"" is not your only priority. Getting it SAFE to drive is most important.

Edit - Just so you know... These cars are stupid simple to work on, and parts are CHEAP. As an example, I bought a Country Squire wagon a few years ago and the first thing I did was replace every single damn wearable part on it... All fluids, shocks, springs, belts, hoses, complete ignition system, bushings, tie rods, brakes, brake lines, fuel line, fuel pump... Literally everything... 

It took a week and about $600 in parts. Since then, I've put 80,000 trouble free miles on a 27 year old car that feels like brand new. It's totally worth doing things right, and while the Escort isn't the same as mine, the economics and ease of repair are similar. ",1

They replaced and reprogrammed the clutch and the situation improved a fair bit but the jerkiness at low rpm  is annoying as fuck and as a first time car owner is fuckin bs.

Further,I guess people don't know what they're getting when buying  a DCT transmission which I guess is an automatic/manual hybrid.

Ford,So i got my free transmission and clutch but the gears still slip in the lower gears the jutting and dragging is quite obvious. It's okay once it gets past 50Km/hr but slow driving is a joke. I've read that the clutch issue is massive and Ford rarely tunes the transmissions to 100%. What should I do? I can take it back to ford over and over but i'd rather not do that. ,1

The Vista roof is probably my favorite feature.",6
Ford,I'm a lube tech at a Ford dealer and a half shaf leak is almost a given on 90% of the escapes I see. They tend not to leak after being fixed the first time. Also the 3.0 leaks from the front cover a lot and it's a very expensive fix. Only other common problem I see is sway bar links going bad quickly,2
Ford,Looks awesome! Enjoy,2
Ford,"My dad had a MkII XR8, was a great car, really nice sound and everything. Never got to drive it unfortunately, as I was too young.

That said, if you can, get a BF. They're better equipped, and have slightly better power and economy. If you're not fussed about having a V8, get a 6 Turbo, they're arguably better in almost every aspect.",1
Ford,"Oh man I've had two 2005's. Both ate end links.

The v6 had seeping on the lower engine. And only the v6 had a bad axle on the front passenger side. Otherwise my 2.3 awd went to 156k miles and was totaled and the 3.0 I traded in at 130k. Only other issue was alternators on both went about 120k

Ford,"I though the same thing! Mustang Gt-R
",7
Ford,There is a little in line tester tool that has a light in it that flashes with each spark.  That will test the coil and wires.  Or you can simply pull out all of them and then plug the wires back onto them and carefully lay them open resting somewhere on the head away from all other things/wires/moving parts.  Then have somebody eyeball them as you turn the car over.  They have to be touching the head to make the circuit work.  A lot of air and gas vapor will be blowing up through the open spark plug holes FYI.  That will also let you smell the gas.,1
Ford,Well first i would crank it for a long time.  Get a battery charger.,1
Ford,There are YouTube videos that show you how to check spark in your car,1
Ford,"Hmm last car I looked at the hose it was a standard t and the hose plugged into it. Newer system may be different. Umm is it the T that splits between the wipers or just one side ?

I can check my gf's 2012 fusion to see if that is similar, but that won't be until Sunday. I'll check my escape but not sure how close those are.

If you can swing by an auto parts store they may be of assistance. And they are open later.",2
Ford,Looks fucking awesome!,2
Ford,The hose runs up and to a T which is like a round piece that connects to the nozzle for the passenger side and the drivers side just is a round part only.  Kind of hard to explain ha.  If you find out let me know.  I'm going. To autozone tomorrow afternoon after work. ,1
Ford,Ok I will go out and find on of those inline tester thingy. Will let you know the results.,1

Ford,"Hard Ground Canyon, New Mexico... McKinley county.",1
Ford,"Do you like the grill styling?  it seems more Taurus-like than the older ones.  I was partial to the ""bear-face"" of the previous generation, but i'm trying to get excited about the new one.  Are there any other styling changes you have noticed that are particularly nice?",1
Ford,Get ready to fill up often. ,1
Ford,"I prefer the new over the old, maybe the blacked out grill is selling me?

The new LEDs look awesome, especially since they run 24/7 with the headlights so it always has that look.

The rear is kinda tricky. When I saw pictures of it, I hated it, but in person it truly did grown on me. It's not the most unique taillight but it's awesome at night. Being the sport, the whole light bar lights up when I break, and it uses LEDs so it's bright and clean.

The side has the sport trim going around so it does give a sportier look.

Interior is much better. I can't emphasize on how much more roomier it is, the technology is better than the previous model (al thought I'm still stuck with myfordtouch). Lots of new features.
They finally got rid of the annoying touch sensors for radio and temperature with let me tell you is the best thing. 
The panel is so clean and easy to use. 

Steering wheel is a tad bit smaller, they changed the light and window wiper sticks to a new design, still has the dial on the left for outside lights.
Back seats recline and holy crap they made the trunk huge compared to last model.

Beautiful car, only thing I really dislike is in the old model, you used to be able to spin the dial all the way to the left and the car would essentially black out. No light emitted at all besides the interior touch screen. In this model when you spin the dial the LEDs stay illuminated and they can be seen from far, so no more sneaking around haha.

Besides that I love it. Twin turbo is fun to drive around with, AWD so I'm set for the next michigan winter.

Ford,"Watch your fluid change intervals, don't hit curbs and bumps too fast and this thing will outlive your children. I'm currently on my second ranger and when I told my GF I wanted a new truck, she goes ""you just want a newer better ranger right?"".

I would recommend you go to Tractor Supply and get a low profile in-bed tool box. I used to store my crap in the back seat area and those popout windows are expensive to replace (at least $350, usually more). Get a toolbox and keep your valuables, any backpacks, some basic tools and emergency supplies back there at all times. 

Check you plugs often, and use anti-seize. The back ones can be a bitch to get out on those German Vulcan blocks.",1

You can sometimes find them cheaper than the 4.6 because some people think they can charge a premium for the ""Mustang"" block, even though it's no different. If I remember correctly, the 5.4 should have the same connection points in terms of heads, accessories, engine mounts, trans, etc.",4
Ford,"Sync can only give directions through the phone if the vehicle is not equipped with nav. This is done by creating an account on syncmyride.com and then pressing the voice button in the car and saying ""services"" it will then dial sync services where they can get directions, traffic, movie show times, stock quotes, and sports scores. 

It runs $60 per uear. A fraction of the cost of onstar.",1

Edit: also just save your money and buy a new truck isn't always that simple. The insurance increase on a new vehicle and payments may not be in the monthly budget. Even without payments it may not be worth it to OP just to buy a new truck, since obviously he didn't ask about whether he should build the motor or buy something else. ",2

I'm running a 93 race tune from MPT and love it on my 2011 5.0",1
Ford,Well ya I guess that would be better. I saw the looks and was very excited! ,1
Ford,"As someone who had a full bolt on with nitrous 99 4.6 F150 I can tell you this. Don't bother with anything other then boost. Does the motor no longer run? Does it actually need a rebuild? Is it down on compression? If you just want more power. Swap PI heads from a 99-04 GT or 2001-2004 2v 4.6 5.4 f150. This will up the compression on your non PI short block a full point. This along with headers, actual dual exhaust with an H or X pipe and 2.5"" pipes and you will make some decent power even with the stock truck intake etc... You could swap the intake etc.. from a mustang over for more power. But you would need better rear gearing to use the power as it will now be higher up in the rpm range. 3.73's would be a good street gear. ",1
Ford,Least possible,1
Ford,"Ok, basically what I'd like to do is a top end rebuild without having to remove the block. Is it worth p&amp;p the PI heads / Intake? Of course after she's breathing good then I'd do true dual w/2.5"" like you said.",2
Ford,What kind of benefits do you see from a tuner on the ecoboost? More power? More mpg?,1
Ford,the nozzle is broken. ,2
Ford,I've heard the awd explorer with the 3.5 ecoboost and a tune runs a 13.8,2
Ford,[deleted],1
Ford,"I had a 100hp, then 150hp shot on my non PI headed 4.6 f150 and it was still kind of a dog. The heads and intake need to be swapped to make power. ",1
Ford,"Excellent choice I have a 97 Ford Ranger XLT with
305K on it. 
Everything that's been replaced was an original part.",1
Ford,"Is it worth it with the factory cams, not really. And on a budget not possible. Honestly if you want around 300rwhp all motor 4.6 on a budget. Get a set of 99-04 PI heads and intake manifold from a GT mustang. At the least you need good short tube headers, an h or x pipe and 2.5"" like I said. Run a straight through muffler like Dynomax bullets, Magnaflows etc... The truck will of course need to be tuned for all this extra compression etc... to run well and make the most power. Other then doing that, you can spray it. ",1
Ford,"Thanks. I guess that's easier. 

The piece of the nozzle that connects into the hose (the black round piece that's pictured) broke off at the connection of the hose, like broke completely off and inside the plastic piece as well :-/.  So not sure if they'd also have to replace the hose now or not.  Or just undo the T (if possible) and do it that way. ",1

Ford,The backfires sound amazing!,1
Ford,"It's been a while since I looked into it, but I think the block is exactly the same as a 4.6 from the outside. It just has a larger bore and/or stroke, increasing the displacement. The height factor is from the intake. That's where people were having issues swapping the 5.4 into Crown Vics and Mustangs and they needed a cowl hood or cut a hole in it. I could be mistaken though. Maybe I'm thinking of the Lightning motor swaps...",1
Ford,the 5.4 has a taller deck,1
