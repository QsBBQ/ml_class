Toyota,What kind of truck? Is that the wrong question? &gt;.&lt;,1
Toyota,"I'm a bit of a traitor here, but it's a Nissan Titan. What can I say, it was cheap.
",1
Toyota,Those are a good truck though. I used to sell them.,1
Toyota,"Time can do as much damage as miles though, more so if the car isn't driven. If it has been sitting it could have a bad battery (not necessarily immediately apparent), bad brakes, flat-spotted tires, etc.",2
Toyota,"Not gonna lie, I hate it lol. It's more of a personal thing though, left a sour taste in my mouth after catching on fire the first day I bought it. Then the alternator died and left me stranded the next day.",1
Toyota,"That looks right to me. The silver rim things are called trim rings. They are more or less universal to a size, so you just need a 15"" one. 

PS for the price of a brand new steelie and a little elbow grease, you could get a junkyard set of alloys and clean them up.",3
Toyota,Holy crap. It caught on fire?,2
Toyota,I was talking about the other A,2
Toyota,"That sounds very much like a spun bearing, I think it's going to need a new engine before long.

As for valves they aren't adjustable to my knowledge but that's on my 02 corolla.",2
Toyota,automatic or manual? I love how smooth and clicky the manuals shift.,2
Toyota,Nice mkiii behind it!,1
Toyota,"Taking a gamble and bought it for $3300. Made the decision on how the car sounded and on the seller (seemed pretty honest and knowledgeable; owned 5 cars and maintained all of them himself). So basically made a gut call.

Will probably get it checked out later to see if anythings out of wack. Anything besides the battery and tires I should be wary of? The break pads, rotors and oil changes were some of the maintenance he's done himself. ",2
Toyota,That's a Japanese licence plate. ,1
Toyota,My battery isn't that old tho. ,1
Toyota,nice! i love these things. I opted to go smaller and just bought an 87 4runner for the same price haha,1
Toyota,where are you located? I have two rims just like yours from my toyota painted black that i'd give you if youre nearby . the chrome rings are called beauty rings btw,2
Toyota,the wheelin his link is a 6 lug and the one on the truck are 5s though,1
Toyota,"Take it to a mechanic to do a pre-purchase inspection (something that never gets mentioned enough in this/any sub regarding used cars...), mention the valve train noise when accelerating. They'll give you an honest answer. Don't buy a pile just because it's family. ",2
Toyota,"Did that article just say ""quieter cabin""!?  Absolutely not.  It still makes plenty of noise at speed. And what is worse, during acceleration, my 2015 Corolla LE with CVT sounds like a turbocharged leaf-blower with a bolt loose. I have a 2003 Corolla L with auto trans and it is very, VERY QUIET by comparison. I'm pretty sure I'm getting some kind of artificially elevated engine noise that is by design, engineered. I'd like to kick the engineers. What can I do to fix it?",1
Toyota,yep!,1
Toyota,"It is just an Avalon:

Toyota,Nice! here is my first gen Soarer project: http://yojiko.com/k4/MZ12GT,2
Toyota,"CVTs are weird, at least my experience with them has been. We had a 2009 Altima Coupe with a CVT, and it always felt very distinctive when it changed gears. I mean like when someone makes a shift in a manual too quickly and its jerky. It felt like that a lot of times. It would also stay in 2nd or 3rd gear going down a hill when it should've definitely been in 3rd or 4th respectively, it always felt like it was loading up. The way I got accustomed to driving that car was shifting it myself, and I didn't have those issues as often. 

As for the sound, you're the first person I've heard comment on the sound amplification in a Corolla. You could very well be right. Embrace the racecar!",1
Toyota,Fj60 is manual. The fj62 is auto. Same body style but square headlights. ,2
Toyota,I'm very sorry to hear this happen. If my 91 soarer was hurt i would probably cry,1
Toyota,"I have a 2014 LE with a CVT and that engine sound and shifting is the CVT doing it's job. The general idea of a CVT is that you are always in the most efficient power band at all times. If you're constantly driving with a lead foot then the engine will stay at higher rpms and will make the sound like you are hearing. Also, Toyota put in artificial 'shift' points to help people coming from a standard automatic not feel so awkward. Try keeping the car in ECO mode with the little green light on the dash as you accelerate and see if you still have the same symptoms. ",4
Toyota,"Confirmed. I have a 2015 LE, the CVT won't do what OP stated is you drive it ECO all the time. I feel like the hard acceleration sound is realistic for the size of the exhaust pipe. If you look at other 1.8L engines, you will see a much smaller diameter exhaust pipe, this year Corolla looks to be significantly bigger.",3
Toyota,"I don't know OP, right now you and I are not on speaking terms...

That thing is gorgeous. ",1
Toyota,[deleted],5
Toyota,"That ""I shoulda waited"" feeling.",2
Toyota,"I'm no expert, but It had a +\- switch, and you could distinctly feel the RPMs reduce after hitting +. That's all I know. I hated that transmission - I also know that.",-1
Toyota,"I sell for Toyota- and I have some insight into the ""shifting"" you notice. When Toyota came out with their new CVT's, they tested terribly with focus groups. No one liked them. It felt alien. So Toyota incorporated simulated shift points- the transmission doesn't stay in its optimum gear range 100% of the time- it lets the speed build up and then jumps forward a bit to get into the most efficient range. After incorporating this, the focus group testing went through the roof positive. So, to make people happy with this new technology, they had to sacrifice a little bit of efficiency. Kinda stupid, but it is what it is. 

As far as OP- Yes the CVT is exactly what you are hearing.",2
Toyota,[deleted],2
Toyota,"Not saying it's specifically the case for the 2015 Corolla, but just for folks who aren't aware, [fake engine noise is totally a real thing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/americas-best-selling-cars-and-trucks-are-built-on-lies-the-rise-of-fake-engine-noise/2015/01/21/6db09a10-a0ba-11e4-b146-577832eafcb4_story.html).",1
Toyota,"The emergency brake was stuck on just enough that by the time I made the 200km drive home from purchasing it, it heated up enough to catch the undercoating and what-not on fire. Not like big flames and shit, but smoke was billowing from underneath, and it smelled vile. ",1
Toyota,"It's like cards in the bicycle spokes.
",1
Toyota,I will try. Are you saying that the car will accelerate just as fast?,-2
Toyota,"Yes, it is exactly like that! I had thought of other ways to describe it, a munchkin jackhammer, a leaf-blower with a bolt loose, a weedeater on nitrous. But it sounds like cards in bicycle spokes more than anything.
",1
Toyota,"No, it won't accelerate as fast but this car isn't meant to be driven like that. It'll do it for sure but it's not a performance vehicle by any means. If you want a car that's more suited for quick driving a Mazda 3 might be a better fit for you. ",3
Toyota,"generally google is super helpful for stuff like this if you can't get any word of mouth suggestions. Christian Brother's has a lot of good reviews and my brother used their Houston location and he was happy with their work. I'm pretty sure they aren't cheap like a backyard mechanic, but I can tell you first hand you get what you pay for. Had a backyard mechanic install a C/V joint and it fell out a week later when I was going down the road. Thankfully it was a manual trans so I didn't ruin the car...

you can also go to the /r/dallas subreddit and find a fellow redditor to do the repairs you need for a cheaper price and they can likely come to you. At the very least you'll pander to a larger audience...",1
Toyota,"true. yeah those are 4x4 toyota wheels he linked. 

With a 2WD a lot of different wheels will fit. Jeep 5 lugs, some chevrolets, etc.",2
Toyota,"&gt; Also, Toyota put in artificial 'shift' points to help people coming from a standard automatic not feel so awkward.

It annoys me that automakers do this with CVTs. Kinda defeats the purpose.",1
Toyota,"I was pushing for a manual transmission, even though those cars were in short supply and I had to look around to find any. Then I read about the magical CVT, with its better gas mileage because it is more efficient, and better PERFORMANCE because it is more efficient! But it seems like they've nixed the performance advantage with this fake gear stepping nonsense. So now I feel ripped off. If I had a MANUAL transmission, economy car or not, then I can GET performance out of it when I need it. So it turns out I paid extra just to be treated like some schmuck from a focus group who can't appreciate superior new technology. Engineer: More torque! Highly efficient! Better economy, better performance! Gro√üartig! Focus group member: MOAR REVVING MOAR SHIFTING HATE CVT NOMNOMNOM",0
Toyota,"I am not about to buy a new car. This one has 5000 miles on it and I cannot afford to switch. If I switch later it will probably be to a manual trans Civic. I don't like Mazdas, rather have a Ford. What I would like is a way to change the computer on this Corolla so it stops that gear stepping nonsense. And if there is any artificial noise being added, I'd like to find out about that and get rid of it. ",-1
Toyota,"Totally defeats the purpose. If they are going to put these training wheels on the car in order to baby idiots, they should have a switch you can flip to turn it off. ",-2
Toyota,"Oh yeah, it's ridiculous and totally defeats the purpose. ",1
Toyota,"Haha. Yea, you could look at it this way. You still get better performance and fuel mileage than a conventional- or even a manual... Just not as much as literally possible. I would imagine the amount you give up in order to simulate those shift points is in the range of 1-5% from optimum, which is still head and shoulders above a conventional transmission. Plus fewer rotating parts, less overall weight, and less maintenance. The CVT will last longer with less to worry about. It's still a win-win. ",1
Toyota,"Keep in mind... This is a Corolla- not a sports car. They don't have the XRS anymore. They are introductory subcompact vehicles that work great, look great, and sell great. In fact, 80% of corollas sold in the last 20 years are still driving on the road today. So- don't be upset that your 0-60 time isn't awesome. It's not supposed to be. ",2
Toyota,Valves are not adjustable on the 4A-FE (used on 88-92 Corolla) either. ,1
Toyota,Yea that's what I thought I was going to adjust the valves a few years ago just to find out it can't be done.,1
Toyota,"The performance is much worse than my 2003 Corolla, which I still own. I think. I guess I could be wrong. It seems worse. They have the same size engine. I suppose I could take them both on the 1/4 mile and get you times. Maybe next week. I can take recordings too. The 2003 has a bad catalytic convertor, and it still makes less noise than the 2015. The service rep just tried to tell me a bunch of mumbo jumbo about how my new CVT doesn't have fake gear shifting, and most of it sounded like BS but he did say something about a passing mode and that sounded plausible and also like a really nice story. ",1
Toyota,That sucks. I never trusted Nissan's. I sold them and would own a brand new one. But if I'm buying used I want a Toyota.,1
Toyota,"And that is why I bought it, because of Toyota's reputation for reliability. I almost got a Civic but it didn't have enough headroom. Yes I don't care about the 0-60 so much as being deceived. And the loud noise. The fake gear shifting is annoying but much less so than the noise. It sounds cheap. This may be an economy car, but it is a $19000 economy car, and I expect more. Getting oil changed now and they'll take it for a drive.  The rep told me just now that it is noisier than the 2003 because they use lighter material, plastics, etc. Earlier at home I revved the engine in park, and it was pretty quiet, even up to almost redline. The excess noise is happening when it is being driven, so if nothing is wrong with it according to Toyota, I'm guessing the noise is coming from the CVT itself or maybe a sound booster of some sort. Maybe I should just go the other way and do something to the exhaust to make this car ridiculously loud. At least then it wouldn't sound like a weedeater. ",1
Toyota,"I'm fairly certain there is no artificial noise on a corolla, those are mostly for cars that used to have a signature sound or a lot of power and loud sounds. When a person buys a corolla they know they're getting a rather weak engine with great mileage. If you keep your foot pressed down, it will stay in high rpms until you get to your desired speed, thus producing a LOT of unnecessary noise. In my experience it will only have artificial shift points when it is almost all the way to the floor when it's near redline. However my normal driving habits I prefer to keep my rpms under 2000 while accelerating and it's a very quiet car. (2014 Corolla S+). 

I think you're just SOL unless you change your driving habits. 

Not implying anything, just curious, but may I ask how old you are? I stopped being a leadfoot around 24, when I realized zipping around people in the city and passing at 15 over only to stop at the next light with them was absolutely pointless. That said, on my long commutes of 5 to 6 hours a week I usually have it close to 10 over on the interstates. ",4
Toyota,I've only run into them if I'm driving like a jackass for fun. If I'm accelerating slightly faster than normal I have no shift points. But if I get near redline I get the shift points. ,1
Toyota,"It only happens in my 2014 corolla S + if I'm near redlining it, all other driving for me has no shift points. I'm a little faster than a grandpa, but only barely faster than a turtle usually.",1
Toyota,"I'm in Texas and they have the lights timed here in most places so that if you accelerate fast and drive 10-15 miles over the speed limit you catch all the green lights. Since they start writing tickets at 10mph over, it pays to accelerate. Also I like to get away from the group of vehicles because it is safer. On the highway, it is illegal in Texas to drive under the speed limit in the passing lane, but that doesn't stop Barney Fife from waiting behind a tree to write you up so the locals in his area don't have to pay property tax.  It gets really bad in the country areas, where the cops have no real crime to police, and they lower the speed limit every time some drunk has an accident. ",1
Toyota,Yea it's kind if similar here in WI. I usually have my own routes to avoid dumb light timings.  I don't know what to tell you man. Maybe look into spending a few hundred on a better sound dampening muffler? They must exist. ,1
Toyota,"I don't think it will help. The sound seems to be coming from the engine compartment/CVT, and not the muffler. Is there anything that might help? Additional insulation in the engine compartment?",0
Toyota,"I will have to try driving like a not jackass for fun. I had already noticed that if I didn't push it up towards redline too fast it would take longer to reach the shift point, but the shift points seemed unavoidable. ",1
Toyota,I'm afraid we've gone beyond my current knowledge. Sorry. Good luck though.,2
Toyota,"Forgot to add that I got this grille from rockauto.com It fit ok, but the lower brackets don't reach the holes on the body, so it's only connected by the top ones. It's sturdy, but just something to keep in mind if you replace yours. Also, I had to drill out a hole for the 'V6' emblem screw hole. ",1
Toyota,"I've heard some of those LEDs can have too *little* resistance and therefore won't turn on (or they'll be really dim).

I **believe** a resistor should fix it.",1
Toyota,I would take that 89' in a heartbeat. No offense to the 15' but I just love love love those older tacos! More pics now! ,4
Toyota,"Shouldn't matter at all if its a salvage title as far as I know. When the VIN is entered into the vehicle inquiry tab on TIS, we don't see any title information on the car, just warranty info, service history, and the like. If you want to PM me tomorrow before noon, I can enter your VIN just to see if anything irregular shows up, as well as check it for open recalls.",2

Toyota,"Try driving a truck for a week, I'm 19 and rarely put my foot down for any more than entering the freeway. Something about flooring it meaning I go from 14 mpg down to 8 is a pretty good discouragement to speed. ",3

Toyota,Totally /s. I love Toyota but the prius IS hilarious. This guy's just being a dick. Kudos on the effort for that meme.,1
Toyota,Toyotalanche,1
Toyota,"Ok so the 2006 is the same generation as my 2002 and i actually soldered an auxiliary cable to the board of my original head unit.  I based the way i did it off of this guys video of him doing it the the previous generation 1999 solara (camry coupe basically).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIswrodoM8

When you look at the head unit, it is a little different than this guys stereo but it helps you to understand how to do it to your own car. 
It's a little risky as if you are not decent at soldering or understanding some basic electronics, then you could mess up the head unit.
You just have to take the head unit out and then remove the back and top of the unit, once you open it up there is a spot on the board where the cassette tape player is connected to the main board.  and then find the spot near it that looks like the one the guy in the video uses(if i remember right there are two spots like this in the area)  but the one i used was toward the front of unit and close to the volume/power button side.  Take the aux cable that you want to use and cut off one end and strip and separate the 3 internal wires. connect the ground wire (normally the winding) to one of the screws holding the board on (there is one about an inch away from the connection point) then solder the positive wire (normally red) of the aux cable to the spot on the board marked with a ""+"" and the negative(white normally) to the ""-"" spot.  then you just have to run the cable to where ever you want your connection point.

It's definitely worth it because that is a very good, powerful, and reliable head unit.  You will get perfect quality music playing as long as you give it good music to begin with.  I did it for under $10 as i bought a 6ft cable that i eventually ran under the center cup holder unit and out behind the e-break to where it runs into the the center console and is connected to a little bluetooth device.",1
Toyota,"For the Celica, which trim?",3
Toyota,"I may seem old fashion, but the first gen Tacomas are just so well built.

Toyota,"Make sure your fuel pump is working well. I have 238k on mine and one day it was running fine, went to start it the next day and it wouldn't turn over. Assumed it was the fuel pump and it was. As far as I know there really isn't any warning, it just stops working one day.",2

They'll try to trick you by saying ""what can you afford for monthly payments"" and that  crap where they come back with the sales manager to reassure you that the deal they offer is great and cannot go any lower. just get up and thank them and let them know to call you when they can get down to the price you want to pay.

In my experience, the only things that dealers are good for are warranty repairs, recall repairs, electronic interfaces ( troubleshooting electronics), and maybe their parts counter for parts you can't get elsewhere. For almost all other maintenance issues, you get much better value and often superior service from an independent mechanic. Most of my dealer experiences were negative, but that's anecdotal.

If you are going to do the save money thing, find a used 95-98 single cab 5spd tacoma for under $3000 and run it to the GROUND. parts are cheap on it. you won't have 4x4 or comfort, but it'll have ac and get good gas mileage and be dependable. Once you feel comfortable with your mortgage you can start saving for your next vehicle.

I've tried the whole ""sell this to save this"" and it just got me in more trouble. Maintain what you are comfortable with. If you can't afford your truck and a mortgage you may be better of waiting till the truck is paid for - then you know you have a GOOD truck.",1

It's a little sluggish at first but the thing about the T4R is that it's really setup to maximize fuel economy. I swear that 80% throttle position is only 50% power, but once you push the skinny pedal to the floor it jumps to life. I came from a small 4 door german car with a V8 and it was a blast, I got used to the 4Runner pretty quick and I don't think I would consider a supercharger even if they made one, it's totally fine. Interior is awesome, I got the Limited so it has bells and whistles but I would have been as happy in a Trail edition if I could have gotten it with the 3rd row.

Toyota,Lol. We're you able to read the commentary below the pictures? It's apparently not showing to everyone. I'm actually upset that my MPG isn't higher.,3
Toyota,"No It's not showing any commentary, just the title of the pictures.
My ""average"" over the life of my entire car according to my stats screen is 30.4 currently. I don't really actively try, but that's what I get.
I could probably get to 32 Which is what the dealer advertised to me when I bought it, if I was a little less heavy on the pedal and a little more conscious of where and when I was driving. ",2
Toyota,"Try it again. I re-saved it and it's showing for me again. I'm only averaging 28.489 MPG, even though my typical highway MPG is ~40 and my typical city is ~31.",2
Toyota,"I think the only input I have is, electronic MPG measurements are dirty liars.  

My car regularly reports +/-5mpg in either direction.  My advice, take the computer with a grain of salt.  

I've never really seen one of those be accurate better than with in +/-2mpg and that's doing really well

As a side note to this, EPA estimates really are very liberal these days it seems like.  I will say I've been able to best my EPA estimates on my 2011 Honda Insight, but it's really really tough and requires excessive 'hypermiling' to do.  

Contrary to this, my brother owns a Honda Fit that should realistically get something like 30 MPG or better combined, but he rarely gets close to that as a legit tank to tank, hand-calculated, average.",4
Toyota,"I figured as much that it was incorrect.

I employ hypermilling to an extent, as the cruise control isn't worth anything above ~45 MPH. Low speed with no stopping, it's great, but on the highway, it's worthless. My tachometer flies sky-high, my fuel economy displayed will drop to 20-25 MPG, and it's mildly infuriating how inefficient it is.

Due to that, I try to keep a constant eye on my MPG and make minor adjustments accordingly to keep it as high as I can.

My last vehicle was the first vehicle I kept detailed statistics about, and, while it wasn't the greatest, at least my overall MPG was above the in-city estimates. 

I've contemplated taking my car for a cross-country drive just to see if ~90% highway would significantly increase fuel economy to where it would be within EPA estimates. Just gotta find the time to take off work.",1
Toyota,CVT or stick? ,2
Toyota,"My Corolla is CVT. 

As far as I can tell, only the base model L and top model S have manual transmission options. I chose the mid-tier model LE.",1
Toyota,That's my last resort. ,1
Toyota,"gotcha, cool cool. I'll be honest, if it's anything like my Insight, anything north of about 68mph is just screaming on the rpm range, it's kind of sad.  The gearing should have been lower on the top end in my mind.  ",2
Toyota,"While I don't have a toyota, my mazda gets weird mileage at highway speeds. Under 70 I can get an average of 30-32 but if I go cross country I usually go 76-78 mph and get right on the EPA 28 highway. So I imagine if you don't get it now it's just going to drop really hard. It's just how fast you go. And mine is a 2.0 with standard trans running about 4-5k rpms. ",2
Toyota,I really like it when people do mods like this. Great job!,1
Toyota,I've been on that thread. Thanks for the heads up though. ,1
Toyota,Balancing the tires will not fix loose steering - you need to have the steering rack inspected.,2
Toyota,"Which tires are on it?
What pressure do you set them at?
How many miles on your truck?
I've got a 2014, the factory tires are total crap, the sidewalls are the strength of donuts.  I've been through several trucks in the past. Passenger car tires (See that P on your sidewall) aren't good for steering on trucks with large high profile tires.  Mine also have a slight out-of-balance shimmy feel to them at specific highway speeds.

First step: Make sure your tire pressure is good. The door sills say 32psi front/rear, but I found running mine at 35 front/rear firms up the ride just enough to get rid of quite a bit of the steering vagueness from those crappy tires.
Also depending on your mileage, there's a couple other guesses I'd have;
Stock shocks are toast, buy quality replacement shocks
Steering stabilizer might be toast, but I'd be looking at shocks first anyway.
Replace the tires with quality LT (light truck) rated tires, and I bet you the steering will firm right up.
Swaybar issues shouldn't be happening on a vehicle this new, so I'd doubt that is it.

Also, used certified doesn't really mean anything other than they ran through a standard set of checks. Look at all the exceptions on the paperwork, you'll be shocked. (Mine is CPO also)  And on top of course, they really have no interest in fixing anything minor.  Standard wear and tear usually won't be considered.",1
Toyota,"I have been using www.fuelly.com, and I like it.  My average over 11k in my 2014 Tacoma is 24.4.  Best tank ever 26.8.  It really has a lot to do with driving style and speed.  My truck doesn't have any computer calculation, but the gauge on our 2012 Camry LE  is saying were getting around 29 that's probably 70 % highway.  I like the look of the new Corolla, hope it gives you years of dependability.",2
Toyota,"Soarers are awesome. I love the interior more than supras as well as the accessories like power seats and all and sunroof and that you dont see them very much. That being said. I equally love the supra for different reasons. Id be happy with a soarer, which is pretty much a supra. Even close in dimensions. ",1
Toyota,"That's what I'm trying to get them to do, but it's proving difficult. ",1
Toyota,Around 34k on the mileage. Shocks shouldn't be crapping out that early. Everything points me toward steering but it's a pain the the ass getting them to take a serious look at it. ,0
Toyota,Is that something I can easily do myself?,1
Toyota,"Mine doesn't have a sunroof, doesn't have the same interior, it's a race car that you can drive everyday xD I love it but I've always wanted a supra but they don't really fit in my window to take home with me to the states",1

Toyota,"When I'm doing 75, my RPM is about 2500. When I accelerate to enter the highway, I still don't usually go over 4000.",1
Toyota,"I'm number 19 of 22 in regards to best fuel economy for my specific model/trim. One guy claims his average is 41.3, with 42.3 being his best.",2
Toyota,Ah ok I see what you mean. That's kinda strange as the cvt is supposed to always be in the 'optimal' rev range. ,2
Toyota,"The Toyota Corolla Levin was sold  in the US, they're just rare to see.",-1
Toyota,You need some ¬†Rust-eze¬†Medicated Bumper Ointment.... ,5
Toyota,"That'll buff right out mate, it's nary a scratch",2
Toyota,It is a mean looking car!,1
Toyota,Oh definitely. And they're fun to drive. I got the chance to drive an ae86 and I would love to own one.,1
Toyota,"I'd rather have one of these then my 86 supra that I had back before children, something about it just looks so sleek.",1
Toyota,"This specific model, no. We never got the AE101 Levin. Our equivalent Corolla is the standard 93-97 sedan.

Edit: booplouie is right, it's an AE111",2
Toyota,"Takes a few hours and is greatly aided by another set of hands, if you can find a buddy to help. 

Most shops just replace the entire steering rack, at the cost of about a $1,000. It's usually just a bushing though. 

I'd say get a second opinion by taking to a place like a good tire shop, and ask them to either give it an alignment, or have them check the alignment. When it's on the rack, they'll be able to note any slop in the steering as they're trying to align the front end. 

If you want to try and check it yourself, you can try putting a camera under your truck and aim it towards the bushing on the steering rack. You can then play the video back and see if there is any slop in it. Having another person watch the bushing for a safe distance works too. Please use caution when doing any of this. ",1
Toyota,Nice looking retrofit! I did one on my 05 corolla and its probably my favorite mod. I used thereteofitsource for my components but the acura projectors look awesome. How about a pic of the cutoff?,1
Toyota,"no, this is a japan specific model. 
ae111 was never released outside of japan, produced from 1995 to 2000.

Toyota,"it's the model after the 101, the 111",3
Toyota, How does that even happen? ,1
Toyota,Unfortunately I don't know anyone in that region. Sorry.,1
Toyota,midwest winter,3
Toyota,"Damn, that sucks. ",2
Toyota,It's just a huge shame AE111 are FWD. They look so good.,1
Toyota,Put a can of POR-15 on there and it will be good as new.,1
Toyota,"A good wash,some wax and a case of WD40 it will make all like new. LOL",1
Toyota,MN? I have a buddy who uses 2wd Toyotas for daily drivers. Every single one has looked like this.,1
Toyota,"Eh I liked my 87 supra more, I prefer the classic more boxy look in all honesty.",1
Toyota,Fix a toyota?  What needs fixing?,2
Toyota,"My bet is a first-gen [Toyota Solara](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/99-01_Toyota_Solara.jpg)

EDIT: Wow can't spell ""Solra""",7
Toyota,"I loved my supra but this has that rareness to it, although so did my supra with its two tone blue paint with matching leather interior and a whopping 60k on the odometer, that was right up until some dumbass t-boned it.",1
Toyota,No wonder I've never seen one!,1
Toyota,Yea it doesn't resemble any of the corollas I've owned!,1
Toyota,Write yah mine was a repainted two tone white and grey with a redone blue interior. 250k on the clock. But I loved that car. Up until I was the dumbass and drove it drunk into a cement pole.,1
Toyota,"Ouch! I watched mine come to an end, I saw the bitch stomp it trying to get though traffic as she did I stomped it so she wouldn't hit the passenger door with my wife on the other side. I punched it and broke the rear wheels loose she tapped the back corner of my bumper which spun me into a median ripping the entire rear end of from under the car, no wheels no swing arms sliding backwards on my gas tank as the exhaust pipe piled up under her car, but she never quit running!  ",1
Toyota,So what are you going to do with it?,1
Toyota,"There should be a divider/organizer available as an accessory for the center console. The console is the same for all trims. As far as your discomfort with the height of the console, the only solution would probably be to have the 8-way adjustable drivers seat option where you'd be able to adjust the height of the seat, which comes standard on every trim except the LE.",1
Toyota,"My first thought as well, though Toyota is fond of re-using parts, so it may be a different model of the same era.",3
Toyota,cant beat free,1
Toyota,It will only accumulate garbage if you put garbage in there.,3
Toyota,"Sounds sketch to me. While a bumper replacement can easily be that amount, I'd be seeing if that scratch can't be removed via compound or buff. If it's brutal perhaps, but unless the guy is a complete dick I don't see a new bumper here.",3
Toyota,What is it in? ,1
Toyota,"You need the toyota software to be able to program the transponders.  From what little I've seen about this, you actually need to have a legit copy of the software to be able to do this.  Find another locksmith? Or a dealer of course.",3
Toyota,Model-T?,-3
Toyota,1985 toyota corolla AE86.,1
Toyota,Wait I thought this was r/toyota... I don't recall subscribing to r/volkswagen.,2
Toyota,"Oh shoot, you're right. My bad! 101 had the Silvertop and the long tail light. ",1
Toyota,We never got the good ones. This had the 4A-GE Blacktop 20V and it's very sought after here in the US. ,1
Toyota,Yea we did kinda get the short end of the stick when it comes down to what Toyota really had available.,1
Toyota,"Someone once rear ended me and at the time there was no damage so we parted ways without exchanging info. A month later the top layer of paint on my bumper split open, about 6 inches long or more. Got a quote to fix it from a place I used before, and it was this exact amount if I remember right. I didn't end up paying because it would have been out of my own pocket, and it wasn't that important to me. It does seem like sanding down the entire thing and repainting it to look good as new costs this much I suppose.",1
Toyota,It's a shame. But we always have the option of importing parts and building our own unique Corollas with mismatched performance stuff out of Japan! http://i.imgur.com/vxQF83n.jpg,1
Toyota,"Nice, what year is that? I have an 02 Corolla right now but she's got 257k or her so she's not as sporty anymore but I still love it!",1
Toyota,"It's a 1996. For that year the parts were mostly interchangeable between USDM and JDM models, which is lucky. I have body parts from the FX-GT, SE Limited, and BZ Touring wagon. 

That's great! They're great cars even stock. Mine is stock engine, I still really enjoy it. ",1
Toyota,"Nothin some duct tape won't fix.
",1
Toyota,"I don't either. It was 3 inches long at most, under the front foglight.",1
Toyota,Could you explain your breather setup? What is in the chrome canister?,2
Toyota,"I worked in an independent shop for years and just started at a Toyota dealer. 

Better work gets done at the dealership.  It costs more but it gets done with the proper equipment by people trained by the people who made the car.

When you see Toyotas all day every day, you get better at working on them than someone that doesn't.  ",3
Toyota,"Yeah, that light only comes on before you start your car in a Toyota",1
Toyota,"hmm. the ""Valdez"" sticker leads me to believe this truck spent some time in Alaska. ",1
Toyota,I agree.,1
Toyota,You buy it through velocity cars? ,1
Toyota,Is there no part number printed on the back of it?,1
Toyota,"Yep that's about right especially for a car that's only four years old, turn it over to your insurance company and be done with it.",1
Toyota,"Unfortunately, there is not. I've always found Toyota to be pretty touch and go on part numbers. ",2
Toyota,Your not from wicklow Ireland by any chance ,1
Toyota,"It's an oil catch can, the stock breather fed into the exhaust manifold so any gases and sometimes cruddy oil so now it goods into the canister instead of into my exhaust, in also switching to a header so I wouldn't be able to run the old setup anyways",2
Toyota,Carburated? Thats an AE85.  The 86 has fuel injection,1
Toyota,B-Pro Imports out of Calgary,3
Toyota,"It's an 86, the fuel injection engine, the 4ag is in the gts which is an ae88.",2
Toyota,I'm rather curious why you're importing a RHD Lexus LS400 when you could presumably buy a LHD model in Canada and put on JDM accessories/parts.  Any particular reason?,6
Toyota,"Ah my mistake, assumed you were from Van. The process fairly easy?",3
Toyota,my 240sx is going on 1 year. I really hope it doesnt stretch any longer,1
Toyota,Luckily I saved mine but there's a lot of work to be done from all the years of neglect.,2
Toyota,She just needs me to drop in an engine but i pack the knowledge :/ ,1
Toyota,What are you thinking for a swap?,2
Toyota,its a 90 car. i have a ka dual cam swap but i have to hack the wire harness and what not,1
Toyota,because jdm rhd yo lol,10
Toyota,lol the Toyota fixes itself once the engine's started.,1
Toyota,Smooth hands.,1
Toyota,"Ahhh shucks, some of them have a number and I could do a reverse lookup",1
Toyota,How bad is the damage? Got a photo?,1
Toyota,"If you want the Supra you shouldn't make your car like a Supra. That'd only make it lose even more value.

Just sell the Soarer buy a Supra.",1
Toyota,"I'd look online for a mirror cover. Replacing one isn't too hard.

I recently removed the passenger door panel for a dent repair (I own the same vehicle). Very easy to remove the panel and then you could see what gap you have and why it's there. This might also be a warranty thing.

Chips and scrapes are going to require body work if you want it done perfectly. I've had a Matrix bumper repainted for ~$500.

Those headlights are expensive if you're looking at an OEM replacement. I had one replaced when my Venza got hit (limited version with the LEDs) and the shop price was $2300 for the driver side one. You can get them online for ~$1200.",1
Toyota,"Last I checked 150 watts was the maximum outlets can pull (both to save costs on wiring and keep people from trying to pull too much power).   Your pump pulls at least 174 watts, so likely why it doesn't work with built-in sockets",3
Toyota,I was leaking brake fluid in my pickup and so I filled it all the way up one day and it hasn't leaked a drop since,1
Toyota,cost would be a big factor ,1
Toyota,"Well the venza is fused for 10 amps so it's even less that 150 watts. 

Kinda sucks since I got a socket rated for 20 amps for $10 from the local Canadian tire and it only takes 16 awg wire to handle 20 amps. 

",3
Toyota,You should crosspost this to r/mildyinteresting ,0
Toyota,Will do!,1
Toyota,"
Looks dead on like an 8th gen or possibly 8.5g Corolla.",1
Toyota,[deleted],2
Toyota,"Yes, but will it load Zip Disks....",0
Toyota,Lol I said the same thing myself. Sometime I'll go to a thrift store and find a Zip drive and see what happens.,0
Toyota,"Understood, but multiply that by a thousand vehicles and that's $10,000 (just for the socket, then there's the copper which gets more expensive the higher gauge you go)

Edit: and even though they get them at a lower price for bulk purchases, it's still money they can save",2
Toyota,"Even with an key that isn't programmed, the car should crank but not start. An aftermarket alarm can reek havoc with that system, depending on where &amp; what it's tied into. Sometimes its as easy as pulling the fuse on the aftermarket alarm. ",2
Toyota,"Because it is way cheaper and I can get a way cleaner model this way, also RHD &gt; LHD lol. The car I got has 63,000 KM and I'll be the second owner.",3
Toyota,As long as you like it :),1
Toyota,"If he's got $10k, he'll get a post 1998 corolla. No timing belts. 

Check oil, maintenance records, carfax if any are available. Don't see many corollas that are lemons. Really reliable that just take oil changes, gas, and TLC.",5
Toyota,Uh oh. Looks like they accidentally put the steering wheel on the wrong side. Very poor engineering and planning. ,-1
Toyota,$4800 canadian / $3900 USD total cost landed in Vancouver.. not bad I would say.,3
Toyota,Very easy honestly. Brian is great and very fast.,1
Toyota,"You wouldn't by chance be from winnipeg and frequent toptierimports.com 
?",1
Toyota,Corolla or Matrix buying advice: Buy it quick before somebody else does.,1
Toyota,"Wire ratings change depending on how long the wire is, 16g is fine for a short run but on a longer run it would light up like a lightbulb filament, think of how much wire runs in the car to reach that socket, it would have to be heavier then 16g to perform without being a fire hazard.",1
Toyota,Um corollas don't have timing belts they use a chain?,2
Toyota,Do it! There great little cars. ,1
Toyota,I don't live in Wicklow... but you'd probably spot the car around Rathnew a bit. ,1
Toyota,[deleted],1
Toyota,Really because I own an 02 Corolla and it's timing chain begs to differ.,2
Toyota,"Man, white cars sure are majestic.",2
Toyota,Yeah saw you pull out of the petrol station a few weeks ago car looks good well wear,2
Toyota,Ka20 or 24? And yeah wiring is about a bit h.,2
Toyota,ka24de. ka20 is the honda motor lol but yeah ugh. I hate this hobby sometimes lol,1
Toyota,Haha tell me about it I've sunk almost 1500 on getting my car running since I got it.,1
Toyota,Gonna check it for radiation?,2
Toyota,"We've always bought our used Toyotas from the dealer and we've never had a major issue with one. Corollas are generally reliable all around even if they are a little ""boring"" to some. The only thing to watch are the trims and features that are on some of them. If you're looking at a base model, make sure it meets what you're looking for (remote entry, wheel size, etc.).

Don't be afraid to negotiate a little bit. Even if you only get $500 off, it's still better than $0. The compact car market is pretty competitive right now.",3
Toyota,[deleted],1
Toyota,"Yeah, I used a chart (http://www.offroaders.com/tech/12-volt-wire-gauge-amps.htm) to determine how safe I was using 16 gauge and of course my adapter is only 24 inches in length.

Im thinking of rewiring one socket directly to the battery with an inline fuse using 10 gauge wire but Im unsure if I can find a socket that will fit the OEM one and look stock and be able to handle 20 amps. ",1
Toyota,"This is my exact situation. I had to submit receipts for $3600 to replace the motor, and am being told to hold tight for a month. If you weren't aware there is a limited service campaign ""ze7"" for overconsumption of oil. They say submit receipts for already completed repairs, and are still figuring out how to approach repairing the defective piston rings. I actually owe
we about $9300 too hah. Going to dump the car on carmax (already got 5k estimate w/ replaced engine), and buy my moms malibu. Pretty pissed with Toyotas overall handling of this.

Toyota,"Ive been driving this 1996 rav4 for about 6 months and i cant find the lock release lever. I looked in the manual and it should have one, but i cant find it. any help would be appreciated",1
Toyota,Since 1998 they use a chain AFAIK,2
Toyota,Sounds about right because my old ass sr5 Corolla was a belt ....and after looking it's 90-97 belt and just like you said 98-14 have been a chain.,1
Toyota,People give sawblades crap? I fuckin love em on my 88,1
Toyota,I'd argue the 90-93 as they had the option of the 1j. With that said I loved my 88.,1
Toyota,"Well, I think it's because they're heavy, not wide or very flush with the body. Also being so old they tend to be really peeled and not in their best shape. I dig the look when they are clean pristine. Would be awesome if they made a set wider and 17",1
Toyota,All of them have the option of a 1J swap though!,1
Toyota,Looks way better than the 4runner. Nice ride!,1
Toyota,"Nice to see they dropped the numbers from super white again, i've got a super white 84 supra, they switched to super white 2 shortly after, makes finding paint pens tough :P",2
Toyota,Yup lol,2
Toyota,"Thanks.  I wish I could find a corolla with as little internal electric crap as possible.  It always breaks, and costs too much to fix. ",2
Toyota,Those are all true of most wheels from the 80s tho... And i dig the 16s they fit the car nicely imo,1
Toyota,Very nice!  Are you seeing good deals in the US with the new model on the horizon?  Shame no D4D option for the US market.,2
Toyota,I love them!!,1
Toyota,this is hilarious. I like how you actually have a case of floppies. My personal computer hasn't any kind of disk reader in years. I wish I could find computer cases that just had a slot for a couple of hard drives since I do everything via USB. :P,1
Toyota,"I would just spend the money and try it. If it doesn't work, pay the shipping and return the item for your money back.

I tried to talk a family member out of buying an 04 Rav4 for $7k. It only had 80k miles, but here is what I noticed when I looked at it for her;

All four tires were different makes...
The engine had a small knocking sound...
both front shocks/struts were worn pretty bad...
It didn't have inspection or registration stickers...
I saw the rear end jacked up a few days later when I casually drove by this shady little glass shop...
The guy told her when she went to put the down payment on it that he couldn't give her the vehicle right now, because he can't get it inspected as it was sitting for a long time.

so many red flags. why ask for my opinion if you aren't going to heed my warnings?!
",1
Toyota,Nice. I am happy they still offer manual tranny. ,7
Toyota,Sadly not even remotely. Managed to get $1300 off sticker but we had to drive to a dealership 4 hours away to get the deal/find this specific truck. I've been looking for this particular build for a while and the price has stayed consistently high since well before they released the 2016 specs. ,4
Toyota,Tundra is to Mirai what Mack is to Tundra?,2
Toyota,Looks worth it - tremendous value.  Some come certified radiation free. Would not hurt to run a Geiger counter on it if you have any doubt though. ,1
Toyota,6gc.net has a conversion guide for celicas from that era. The conversion process should be similar.,1

Toyota,You might want to look at the 4Runner or a Tacoma instead if you are serious about 4wd and towing - unibody vehicles aren't great for that and body on frame would be better.,2
Toyota,"&gt;transmission altered to only spin front wheels.

I understand it's the 2wd class but wouldn't it be better to just use a 2wd rav4 rather than have the weight of an awd system but none of the advantages of it? 

Just a thought. I'm excited to see a rav4 competing. ",4
Toyota,True. ,1
Toyota,"I can't comment on the extra stuff like the infotainment system, but I'd be surprised if you ran into electrical problems. Usually you see more of that on VWs.",2
Toyota,Oh. Yes.,1
Toyota,"I went thru the TPAT program at UTI, but i work with a few people that are currently doing the T-TEN program.  they tell me that they get to actually do real work on cars coming into their classroom as repairs.  For TPAT it was different, we had cars that the teachers bugged, but we got a much larger variety of cars, most of which were brand new and straight from the manufacturer.  personally, i would recommend going thru t-ten due to cost and real world applications.  I learned a ton due to the fact that i had great teachers and i didnt fall asleep in class like other people in my class.  

then again, i did get a job with lexus so there is a testiment to the system.  tpat is basically a highly compressed, largely interactive and VERY hands on version of t--ten.   tpat is 12 weeks, t-ten is much longer.  also you are required to complete ALL of your toyota certifications and obtain 2 ASEs to graduate.",2
Toyota,"Thanks for the feedback!! I was looking into UTI but I heard it's really expensive, 12 weeks isn't bad though, I'm gonna be in the T-ten program for 2 years but getting a job at Toyota will be worth it. ",1
Toyota,"We just bought a 2012 Camry LE.  Really happy with it.  The one thing I would say is make sure of the key situation.  The trunk does not have a key hole, so you have to open the door to pull the lever or use the remote on the key.  The car should come with two remote keys, but if not they are expensive, so maybe work that into the deal if one is missing.  

So far we love it.",3
Toyota,"I also did TPAT at UTI but worked and know a lot of people who went through TTen down in Maryland. Program is great is all I can say.

What you should know is that the ""value"" of it depends highly on the dealership or shop you go to after the program. One yota dealer I worked for was great - friendly people, great environment. The next one I worked at was borderline traumatizing with how fucked up it was. Just know, if you don't like a shop then gtfo. ",2
Toyota,"I'm a T-TEN alumni from cypress college California. It's a great program! Takes about a year and a half to complete with 4 core classes: suspension,  auto/manual trans, engine control systems and engine mechanical. They usually help you with finding a job at a local dealer too. ",2
Toyota,"Though they're a few years old now, they're still a little too new to have any common issues at this point. Don't see many problems with them at the dealership I work at.",2
Toyota,"That's...special...

Toyota,"If you keep it in the cargo area, it should be held down in some way. Any loose items (esp heavy ones) become very dangerous in an accident",4
Toyota,"12 weeks for toyota, 1 year plus for the automotive program that is required for toyota.  and yes,  it is entirely too expensive to be worth it.  only reason i went thru with it was due to the post 9-11 gi bill(and it still didnt cover the entire tuition)",2
Toyota,"Wait, this wasn't just stupid people? The engine would literally overpower the brakes? Wow. 

Sorry I don't have an answer to your question op, but I would take the payment, unless you're actually prone to two footing it in emergency situations. The override system isn't going to make a difference for the vast majority of people. It is a good idea for the people that drive unconventionally two footed. (weirdos...)",4
Toyota,I know Yakima makes a spare tire mount for their roof racks. ,2
Toyota,"Yeah, I would say you're on the right track with getting a roof basket and securing it in there.",2
Toyota,"this WAS stupid people.  it was people stomping on the brakes while flooring the gas, along with people using aftermarket floor mats on top of their factory floor mats.  it has gotten to a point where we technicians have to now REMOVE the aftermarket mats before test driving the car and put them in the trunk(if the factory floor mats are still installed.  service advisors also have to advise the customer that driving with both installed at the same time is very much not recommended.  ",6
Toyota,"just out of curiosity(i did tpat at uti) what certifications do they give you thru the t-ten program?  degrees? ASEs? 2 of the guys i work with are currently going thru the t-ten at cypress, but they dont really tell me much about it.",3

Toyota,I thought the suit had something to do with the accelerator being activated in software. Is that not the case?,2
Toyota,"partially.  the brake pedal was being blocked from applying fully by floor mats that were slipping forward.  then a few reports showed that it was not the case in all of the incidents.    i am not an engineer, but i can imagine that there were reasons caused by the driver that their accelerator was sticking...

my favorite part of the article

&gt;Michael Barr of the Barr Group testified that NASA had not been able to complete its examination of Toyota's ETCS and that Toyota did not follow best practices for real time life critical software, and that a single bit flip which can be caused by cosmic rays could cause unintended acceleration. As well, the run-time stack of the real-time operating system was not large enough and that it was possible for the stack to grow large enough to overwrite data that could cause unintended acceleration",4

Toyota,"nice.   yeah i had 2 main instructors for TPAT and 2 previous toyota/lexus DMTs(diagnostic master technician) that were teaching other non toyota courses.  always a plethora of information, plus all of them wrote me letters of recommendation afterwards(which definitely helped me get the job i got now)  

also, they require 2 ASEs to grad out of TPAT and they pay for not just those 2, but if you pass those on your first try, they give you 2 more.  ASEs get mighty expensive and i was able to get 4 of them on my schools dime.   also they signed us up for DELMAR learning center and my account is still active so that is a plus.  

how is the in class dynamic?  what is the lab to lecture ratio?  for us it was 30% lecture, 70% lab.  ",2
Toyota,"thats a great deal if off msrp. they made maybe $500 on a $33-34000 truck, if they were lucky.

It was mostly luck finding the truck, my father happened to call the dealership asking about inventory (nothing listed online that I could find) and they happened to have the exact truck I've been looking for on order already. Picked it up the same day it was delivered to the dealer. Thanks, I'm ecstatic driving it!",2
Toyota,"I looked through your recents, saw the entune w/ nav comment, so yeah.

as a toyota truck champion, you have no idea how rare any tacoma is with nav. did you get it with the jbl as well?

also, check into the short shifter and trd knob. you'll love them.",1
Toyota,"Was that included in the Entune premium audio? I'm honestly not sure, my big wants were the rear diff lock, a-trac, manual, and nav. Whatever else that came with it were extra perks. Thanks! I've heard good things about the short shifter, at the moment I'm getting use to driving the new truck, aside from driving friend's manual cars this is my first manual. My priorities for upgrades are a bed cover, tailgate lock, rock sliders, icon stage 4 3"" lift (much farther out), 33"" tires and new wheels in that order. This is my DD and future overlander. ",1

Toyota,"Beyond easy, and parts are cheap and easy to get.

$1300 seems awful steep though. I paid $300 for mine which only had 150k, which was a steal yes but not $1000 off.

And for what it's worth, don't think Subaru invented the Japanese rally car. [Toyota was doing what Subaru used to do before Subaru was anything more than just a few stars](http://www.automotorblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Toyota-Celica-Twin-Cam.jpg). ",9
Toyota,"Oh yes, I know subaru didn't start it lol, but they've done one Hell of a job continuing it. I guess I thought that $1300 was too little, but the way you explain it, I should start looking for ones that aren't that expensive. Would the Celica be a good candidate as well?",1
Toyota,"If you can find an old Celica sure, but most you'll see on the market now are going to be last-gen models with very unfavorable ground clearance. 

Let me get some perspective on the cost issue. Are you looking for something that is daily driver worthy that you can also tinker with, or are you looking for a rally project that you're going to gut and probably wind up destroying in the woods somewhere. Because if it's the former a $1300 Corolla might not be bad (assuming the vehicle is in good enough shape to justify the cost) but if you're looking for a project car you can do a lot better. 

The thing with 90's Toyotas is the drive train is as durable as anything could be expected to be, it's just the bodies were rust magnets. But if you're going to be bouncing off trees anyway, who cares what the body looks like? 

Sorry if I'm rambling, it's getting late here and I am not be making the most sense. I promise I have a point, and if you can't find it I'll try and make it in the morning. ",3
Toyota,"Does your RAV4 have a 2"" reciever hitch? If so you can buy off-the-shelf Hitchgate which is a spare tire carrier that mounts via your trailer hitch. Otherwise I'm sure you can fab (or have a local fab shop make) a similar carrier. Easiest non-permanent solution I see. ",1
Toyota,"No no, you're good. My DD is a 2003 Forester. This would be just to learn how to rally on 2wd. I'd probably use it for a year, before trying something else or getting my dreamcar bugeye wrx. I'd probably drive it on occasion, but wouldn't gut it or anything, just take out ABS fuse if there is one, and any other little things like rear seats. Just so I could sell it later on...assuming I don't destroy it lol.",2
Toyota,"I just received shipment of a new tacoma. The ""delivery specialist"" aka the woman telling me what all the bells and whistles do had a page long check list to cover. No joke, nearly a quarter of the page was solely devoted to floor mats. Apparently the logic of not stacking floor mats is beyond some people. ",1
Toyota,"""But the floor was sooooooo far away!!""",1
Toyota,How much did the program cost if you don't mind me asking? Did you have to buy a lot of books?,1
Toyota,"Nope looks like no JBL. I'm not really bothered, the current sound system is decent and some new speakers is an easy fix. ",1
Toyota,I'd shoot for a fuel injected AE92 Corolla if you can find one. I have a carbed and it doesn't have a rev limiter. That definitely helps avoid possible damage when you're sliding around on gravel and other loose stuff. The gearbox is a little tall on the five speeds but I've heard you can swap in different ones fairly easily. These cars are bulletproof though. Mine has 195k on the factory clutch and I've been absolutely thrashing it for the last 3 years,2

Toyota,"Stock Radiator?

Also as another member said have you changed your water pump?

My thinking is your IC is dumping a lot of heat  to the ambient air and your cooling system isn't capable of handling the decrease in efficiency from 40+degree C air. 

Some countermeasures could include a remote oil cooler mounted in front of the driver side wheel well, an electric booster water pump, or an improved radiator.

First confirm you cooling system does not have any issues. Check the water temp sensor by running 12V through the circuit and putting it in 0Degree C water and read the resistance from an Ohm meter. 

Also are there any other issues? Power loss? If so you could check the engine compression. Change the oil and check if it's milky.",1

I'd like to buy a sub with on board amp, I just want to install it somewhere hidden, and under the driver seats are a no go. So I am just kind of waiting to decide on that in the future.

aste of money to repair this era Toyota. My Celica was totaled, but I finally traded my corolla because it was to small for my needs. There is even more value in doing the maintenance yourself, because labor isn't cheap. If it's just the radiator and the starter, go for it. You could probably do both in a weekend with a Chilton's manual, basic tools and some Jack stands. Good luck.",2
Toyota,"No. Pretty sure intake and exhaust are reversed on zz blocks. At a minimum, you need one from an s block, probably 5s as 3s probably has different emissions. But definitely not 1zz, it might as well be a Honda. Won't fit.",1
Toyota,"Repair, definitely. If nothing else, think of it this way: You already know what's wrong with this car and what it will cost to fix it. Buying another used car you could suddenly inherit problems that are more costly without knowing it. My '97 Corolla was pretty much mechanically bulletproof and I'd still be driving it today if it hadn't been T-Boned by a Town Car. I miss that car a lot. Repair the Rolla and he'll continue serving you well!! ",1

I have a 2004 4runner that I offroad VERY HARD, as in I do trails I would never think about when I had my jeep.

I once blew both front CV axles and was able to drive it 30 miles home. The tundras are just as dependable, and very capable in work and play. Plus they are actually very easy to work on, and anything you might have a question about can be answered by a slew of forums. Lastly don't let age or mileage scare you. Mine is 11 years old with 100000 miles and I don't see it going away anytime soon.

Edit: plus in situations where Toyota screws up they usually rectify it. My generation of 4runner had a faulty soft touch dash and guess what, I get a brand new one for free 11 YEARS later through a factory replacement program. And I'm the 1st generation Tacoma that had improper frame rust prevention those owners get the entire frame replaced no charge.

Isolate the flow leading to the radiator from the trans and disconnect it; immediately put the end in an empty 1 qt container. Have a partner start the car. Let the container fill, shut the engine off about 3/4 from the top. Locate the fill nut on the top of the trans and clean it. Make it immaculate. Remove the nut and fill the trans with the same amount you just removed. Replace the nut finger tight. Remove another quart, lather, rinse, repeat. After you do this about 10x, the fluid should be as clean coming out as is was going in. Look up the Toyota tech manual for more ( probably important) details. Oh, and only use the exact Toyota fluid your manual calls for. I love Toyotas, but removing the dipstick and calling it lifetime was a pretty dick move.",2

It had 110,000 miles on it by the time we traded it in last summer. Nothing ever wen wrong, it never saw the dealer after we purchased it in the summer of 07. It got the routine maintenance done (even less than that sometimes) and it ran perfectly.

Cam tower oil leak. It's a difficult leak to see, and is usually first noticed by a burning rubber smell coming from the front fender wells after the engine has ran for some time. The parts to fix it are not expensive, but the labor is extensive. 

Front differential howl. I'm unsure of the long-term effects of letting this problem go, but I can't imagine that a differential that isn't clearanced properly is good for anything. You might want to double-check this on some of the Tundra forums, but I believe the check for this was to drive about 50 km/h on a straight, flat road, and let your foot off the gas pedal. Listen closely for a noise that could be a low hum or a noticeable howl. Put the truck in 4WD mode, and if the noise goes away, you've got diff howl.

&gt; Please Note: If you are checking to see if your vehicle is affected by the Takata air bag recalls, it generally takes anywhere from a few days to several weeks for automakers to gather individual VINs associated with a recall. It is important that you check back periodically as a recall on your vehicle may not show up immediately.",2
Toyota,"honestly, if you dont feel comfortable driving it in, ask your local dealership if they have a door to door service available.  basically, what we do at MY dealership is we have a valet drive out to your house with a loaner car, have you sign the loaner contract and they drive your vehicle back to the dealership and do whatever repairs are necessary and authorized by yourself.  recalls usually come with a free tank of gas(in most dealerships) as stated by TMC mandate.  when the repair is complete we will drive the car back to your home, OR if you want to come in to the dealership and drop off the loaner, we do it that way.   it MAY vary from dealer to dealer, but any dealership with a service department concerned with CSI(customer service index) will go out of their way to make the experience comfortable for you.

Tough little car to pick up dates in when you're 16. When I was in high school several of my friends took their driving test in it, it was an easy car to drive.

edited to add; the main issue we had with the car was that it was a bit noisy to drive, didn't seem to be a lot of sound dampning material in the car so road noise and engine noise was hard to ignore.",2
Toyota,"Most likely the gasket in the rear hatch needs to be replaced, you can usually tell if theres a hole underneath from water sitting. Check the struts by bouncing the car as those are usually shot. Look for leaks all over, and check the dipstick for coolant by taking a lighter to it. If it sizzles it has coolant in it, if it just thins out its just oil. Really just go through the car and check that the headlights flip up etc..",2
Toyota,I was searching for a 1980 manual and could never find one online. I eventually found one at a used bookstore for something like $5. Most used bookstores I go into have a owner's/repair manual section that could be worth checking. Good luck!,2

Toyota,"Well 2wd Toyota pickups don't have a tach and I installed one so I don't know the redline, I know its rather low mabie 5500 rpm ",1
Toyota,"I have an 07 and yes, there is a lever to remove it. you can install it in the 2nd row if you want. assuming its the same case as it isn't connected to the center console. ",2
Toyota,"didn't know they never came with tachs, you might have to look into this further, but The ECU shouldn't let you go over the redline, it will cut fuel and stop you, you should have 2 limiters, a redline, and a top speed one (which can be altered easily). Although, hitting the redline too much causes excess wear and tear. 

I did a quick search and found this ""5750 redline on my 93 22re"" This is a slightly different engine, but the difference is minimal  

And a few other searches i found people saying the redline from factory is 5500.

So if you are still worried, i wouldn't take it over 5000, that being said the 22r makes most power at low rpm anyways

Toyota,"Having driven this vehicle in the past ('06 VX) in Dubai, (they are quite popular over there, what with all the off-roading and all) I can attest to what you are experiencing. I would also like to add that it is a mighty fine and tough vehicle for off roading! 

At first it was alarming too, but I got in touch with a couple of SUV mechanics (some Toyota, some independent) and was assured that it is normal. Here's why: At the 110kph mark, the full time 4WD of this vehicle disengages / re-engages. This happens automatically, with no intervention from the driver apart from driving at that particular speed. The reasoning behind this being 4WD is usually not called for in speeds of excess of 110kph, and is usually used in driving situations involving speeds below 110kph. The sound you hear should be accompanied with a light vibration through the steering wheel. 

The solution is to not stay at that transitionary speed but rather 6-10kph above it or below it. (Since the reason for the vibration/sound is the constant disengagement and engagement of the 4WD at that speed.) Unfortunately this is the only solution that gave me a concrete result of the elimination of the sound and vibration. ",1
Toyota,"6500 is the standard cut-off, but as some have said, a standard 22RE doesn't make much power past 5k anyway. I built a 22RE turbo for a friends track car, with HD valvesprings and a mild cam it pulls hard all the way to the 6250rpm cutout which was decided on with longevity in mind. They're a long stroke motor so piston speeds can get very high very fast.",1

don't let that stop you if you want to do something, as sometimes it can help in price for a private seller (or at least not hurt), but keep in mind it can impact it.  

i got a dealership to knock off and additional $750 on a price they had already reduced once because the used land cruiser i was buying had been reshod with 22"" bling rims.

Toyota,"Yes, it's an interference design. 

Unless you're very comfortable with a timing belt replacement, don't do it yourself. Also, I would assume that doing this work on a van would be even more difficult than any other body style. 

Also, replace the water pump with this timing belt. It's not that much more labor, and the pump isn't that expensive. But the labor to replace it on it's own, is huge. 


Edit:
Also, be prepared for replacing things like the tensioner or a pulley. At 177k, they might be near the end of their life cycle. This isn't the time to scrimp on a repair bill. 

When I owned a 4Runner, I would tell my mechanic to replace anything to do with the timing belt, or cooling system, if it looked bad. I sold that truck with over 250k miles (km equivalent), and never had a problem with it. ",1
Toyota,Glorious.,2
Toyota,"I've never done a timing belt but I think I could do it if guided through it either via instructions or YouTube. I found the timing belt kit on Amazon for $166, that's better than the $980 Toyota quoted me and the $800 my mechanic quoted me. 

That really really sucks to hear that it's an interference design =( I was really hoping it wasn't so if it did go out on the highway I wouldn't have to replace the engine",1
Toyota,"Like I said, timing belts aren't the time to scrimp. Good luck with it though. ",1
Toyota,Replace radiator hoses too.,2
Toyota,"That's another thing I always asked my mechanic to look over when he did the timing belts. But I sold my 4Runner with over 420k kms on it, and it still had the original hoses. ",1
Toyota,"OK, I do these t belts multiple times a week so let me give you the skinny. If you MUST do it yourself ( which I don't really recommend unless you're familiar with it) be sure to purchase a Toyota brand factory replacement belt. They have marks on them indicating their correct position on the crankshaft and camshafts which are important since getting a good look at the timing marks on the rear bank is quite difficult.
Ideally you would replace the cam and crank oil seals when you do the belt. If they are original, they will be very hard by this point and are getting more and more likely to leak. Plus, you'll remove the shield behind the gears to replace them, which you need to do anyway for my last point.
 Water pump, replace it. No excuse not to. These things leak, the bearings go bad, etc. This is just as likely to fail as the belt and all of the labor would be wasted if you have to go right back in there when it fails.
A lot of people replace the tensioner and it's pulley as well as the idler puller. I personally don't believe in replacing them unless the tensioner has become weak or the bearing in one of the pulleys is loose or noisy. Honestly, this is extremely rare.
Be prepared. Although professionals can do this job in 2-3 hours (we Toyota techs range from 45 minutes to 1.5 hrs) you will likely take most of a day.

Toyota,Keep it stock. ,1
Toyota,Usually those kind of claims are BS. But if you do exhaust and an intake then you should be seeing those minor power gains. ,1

With K&amp;N air filters ive seen both sides people who swear by them and ones who think there moronic... To me the logic is ... Paper is harder to blow threw then cotton, but cotton let's more dirt and grime in. I really don't care honestly I paid 35$ for the filter and 10$ for the bracket so I'm in it 45$ if I'm not happy I will simply reinstall my OEM airbox ",1

Toyota,Hey! I have a 2014 in slate gray that I bought at Crown! Fuckin' reddit. ,3
Toyota,"You dont want to do this.I have the same van. I have a decently equipped garage, I've always done my own maintenance (even considerably invasive repairs) and I took it to an independent mechanic. Most cars are not conducive to timing belt maintenance, vans just add a pit of alligators beneath it. Very little clearance, high probability of bumping a cam out of place, and unless you replace everything in one go, the labor is wasted. I also ran into a huge problem tensioning the accessory belts as well. Save yourself the time and aggravation and pay an independent mechanic with a good reputation. Do it once, do it right.",1
Toyota,Seriously! I saw one of these driving around the other day. They look and drive like fuckin luxury cars!!,1
Toyota,Personally I think toyota nailed it with the corolla. I just wish I could say the same about the 2016 Tacoma. The lastest gen 4runner looks so f'n badass but they fucked up by not putting the same front end on the taco.,6
Toyota,"Well the used car dealership I got it from days they have wholesale prices on parts and discounts on lake and they quoted me $300 for the whole timing belt kit to be installed, my personal mechanic however (whom I trust) quoted me $800, I hardly even have the money to pay the 300 what should I do? 

Also, update: I took a bit of the cover off to take a peek at the belt to see what it's condition was and it looked very nice, dark, seemingly fresh rubber, I'll get a pic for you guys when I get the whole cover off and maybe you guys can help me determine how detrimental it is I get it done soon.

Btw thank you guys very much for helping me and trying to guide me in the right direction, I've a family of 4 (soon to be 5 in August) to support and I need to take damn good care of this sienna as it will be our shuttle for very many years to come",1
Toyota,"I've never done a timing belt before but I'd really love to learn, and I do know that I need to replace the belt and everything touching it, the timing belt kits I've found seem to include all of that, ill probably have to take it to a shop as soon as I can afford it, I've a full update in a reply to an above comment. Thank you very much for your considerate advise",1
Toyota,"It sounds like a nightmare but I'm one who loves to learn and abetting that ever went wrong with my previous car that didn't require heavy machinery or special tools I did myself, it looks like I'll have to take it to a mechanic when I have the money, I took a peek at the belt and it looks like it's in pretty good condition, I'm just assuming it needs replaced because of the mileage and the fact I've not seen any service records or stickers indicating it's been done ever. Any good way to tell if/when it needs to be done?",2
Toyota,"Obviously first stop is rust. Check if there are any signs of it around the edges, paint bubbles indicate that the metal underneath is already rusting. 

Look at the exhaust smoke after a cold start. It shouldn't be too white or blue-ish. 

Check the radiator cap, there shouldn't be any gunk under it.

Check the brakes, see if the discs are worn evenly. 

Google around to see if you'll be able to find water pump and a timing belt, change those right after buying the car, if you will buy it. 

Ask when the oil was last changed. Then ignore whatever they say and change it yourself, if you buy that car. Better safe than sorry.

Putting it on a lift at some local shop would be a really good idea. Some shops near me offer these pre-purchase inspections for cheap. ",2
Toyota,"No way to really check the condition of it without removing it. But, if you'll call your local Toyota dealer, using the VIN they can give you a service history of any time it was in any dealer and check for open recalls at the same time.",1
Toyota,Yeah I already called them to see if the recalls were dealt with (which they were apparently) but I didn't ask them about service records because I didn't think they'd have any personal mechanics or anything on file,1
Toyota,Imagine its a tachometer. To the right is less efficient.,1
Toyota,"It's hard to tell visually if a timing belt is approaching failure. Some mechanics will actually write the date/mileage inside the cover. Changing a timing belt is a difficult job on any car, but on a minivan it exacerbated by having half the engine under the dashboard. I'm not saying you can't do it, it would just be a very difficult first timing belt change. My first was on a 4cyl Celica- cramped but still plenty of room. I always consider worst scenarios when taking on jobs like this. If I mess up,I'll either need to now have it towed to a mechanic to complete the job correctly and pay for it anyway, or worse, ruin the engine by mis-timing something. Then you have a much bigger problem. In this particular situation, I would recommend saving up the money to have a reputable pro do the work,then you know you'll have a solid ride for many years to come.",1
Toyota,"One thing you can do (and should do) on your own is drain and refill the trans fluid. At 177k, its probably due anyway. Use ATF-3309, drain and refill two quarts with each oil change.",1
Toyota,"I think I paid about $1k for timing belt, all accessory belts, six new spark plugs, and a new water pump. The way I look at it, I make that money back doing all of the other maintenance myself.",1
Toyota,"What will gunk under the radiator cap indiciate? And about the timing belt, if it's been changed, should I still look  at getting that done?",1
Toyota,"Get a trim panel removal tool from the local auto parts store and pry it off. Inspect the clips to make sure they're not broken,  and if not just push and snap it back in. It may take a little force but itll go, just line up the clips to holes.",2
Toyota,"Gunk under rad cap indicates a possible leak in the cooling system, specifically oil mixing with the coolant, that could be a blown head gasket",1
Toyota,Only dealership visits,1
Toyota,"Fyi reddit is anti cold air intake, myself I'm not sure if they do what they claim. However I do know that the manufacturer will sacrifice some performance for noise reduction because that's what the average consumer wants.

Also, it sounds really cool, so I say enjoy it. ",1
Toyota,"Timing belt is something that you definitely don't want to break. Change it yourself (and water pump too, since you're already in there) to be sure. Seller might claim that they've changed it recently, but you can't be sure, unless he has a full service history from an authorised dealership, which I doubt he has. 

You'll pretty much need to find a new motor if it breaks. ",1
Toyota,I have bought many new cars over the years and my best piece of advice is to leave the dealership after you talk numbers. They will be calling you left and right with better offers. Trust me and good luck!,-1

I'm looking for tips on the car itself.  Good tuning options for the stereo, those kind of things!",1
Toyota,"When I bought mine, I had the dealer change the lane-change signal changed from three to five flashes. When you want to change lanes, just quickly push and release the turn signal stalk in the direction you're going and it will blink a few times. I've gotten so used to it.

I fade the radio about two notches to the back. Otherwise, the sound seems pretty front-heavy. I usually turn the treble up to about two notches from the highest and the bass up to three from the highest. Sounds pretty good in my opinion. 

The map in the nav just updated itself out of nowhere and instead of looking flat and 2D, it's angled a bit so it's easier to see what's coming up. Not a tip, just a bit of info. ",2

Toyota,"You will not get navigation with the s plus trim unless you get the manual because the manual comes with the driver convenience package which means you will not get the entune application.

Edit: for clarification the whole radio system is called entune but only cars with Navi get the accompanying application for android or iPhone. Windows phones don't have access to the entune application at all. ",2
